# A function with early returns verifies in work quadratic in their count

## Violated invariant

A proof written with explicit simple tactics must verify in work near linear
in the selected C source, Click source, and certificate
(`docs/internals/verification-efficiency.md`). The checked execution stores
each path's facts whole. A function with `P` early returns, each after the
conditions of the returns before it, has `P + 1` paths, and path `k` holds
the `k` conditions that precede it, so the execution holds about `P^2/2` path
facts. Whatever reads every path's facts is then quadratic in `P`.
Post-execution `simp` and contract certification both do.

The efficiency page already lists this under the context-build rule as a
known violation with no regression. It is independent of how the function is
executed: outside the planner's own builds, about the same counts appear
whether `execute()` runs on the checked `Proof` or through the planner (71,
155, 419, and 1331 through the planner at the sizes below).

Measured on 2026-10-02 with `early_return_fan_out` from
`src/surface/tests/scaling_tests.rs` (a `malloc` null check, then `P`
`if (a == k) return k;` statements), proved by `execute(); simp();` against
`ensures result == a or result == -1`. Whole-verification context entries
(`context_rebuild_entries`) at 4, 8, 16, and 32 returns: 75, 159, 423, and
1335. The last doubling is 3.2 times.

`executing_a_fan_out_stays_on_the_proof_in_near_linear_work` pins only the
`execute` tactic's own work on this function, and
`grouped_proof_finalization_reads_each_path_once` pins only the implicit
empty-effect check. Neither bounds the whole verification.

## Intended regression

A scaling test over `early_return_fan_out` at 4, 8, 16, and 32 returns that
measures the whole verification, not one named tactic: total deterministic
work and `context_rebuild_entries`. Each doubling of the returns must at most
slightly more than double both. Run it for the grouped `execute(); simp();`
proof and for the same proof written as explicit `step()` and `branch`
tactics, so a fix cannot live only in a smart tactic. Keep the claim
unchanged, and include a variant whose postcondition is false on the last
path so the negative result is still reported.

## Acceptance criteria

- Paths that share a prefix share that prefix's facts in the checked
  execution, so the stored path facts of this function are linear in `P`.
- Post-execution `simp` and contract certification read a shared prefix
  once, not once per path that extends it.
- The regression above passes at all four sizes for both proof forms, and
  the known-violation paragraph in
  `docs/internals/verification-efficiency.md` is removed or narrowed to what
  remains.
- Existing positive and negative proof behavior is preserved, and
  `scripts/check.sh` passes.
