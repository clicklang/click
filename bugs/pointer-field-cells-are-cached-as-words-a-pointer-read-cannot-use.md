# Pointer field cells are cached as words a pointer read cannot use

Soundness: incomplete. Existing checked proofs are refused; nothing false is
accepted. Two reads of one unchanged pointer field get different names, so a
proof step that once closed by normalization is refused.

## Current status (2026-11-01)

The representation repair is implemented: composite unfolds observe complete
pointer cells, symbolic storage uses the same `LoadedPointer` identity as an
ordinary read, and same-source pointer observation runs preserve bytes in the
memory-history checker. The named-cell rule compares the full typed read,
including designation and extent. Scalar load handles no longer double as
pointer parameters in symbolic arrays.

Regression coverage checks complete pointer cells, cached/ordinary read identity,
upper-half writes, wrong read provenance, and no-write witnesses for pointer
runs. The retained-field Markdown fixture also checks a bare before/after read
equality after unfolding, sibling stores, and a retaining call. Pointer-run
framing stays bounded as run sizes grow from 16 to 65,536 cells; observation
chains are checked at 8, 32, 128, and 512 cells. The pointer fact-stability audit
has zero differences before and after; its three quarantined fixture failures
are unchanged.

Keep this report open: the original sidecars do not yet meet the end-to-end
acceptance criteria. Against the pre-repair baseline `617ab6c8a`, unchanged
production runs give these frontiers:

| Sidecar | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rbtree_erase_augmented.click` | smart budget at line 544 | missing explicit `erase_spine_minimum` nonempty premise at line 596 |
| `rbtree_size_insert_context_double_far_rotation.click` | smart budget at line 191 | same |
| `rbtree_size_insert_mirrored_context_double_rotation.click` | fold argument equality at line 217 | earlier smart budget for `node->rb_left == 0` at line 203 |

No example proof or C source is changed by the representation repair. In a
scratch erase proof, explicitly normalizing the nonempty-constructor premise
passes line 596, then stops at an unavailable exact rewrite equality at original
line 652, still before the historical pointer-read trigger. The sections below
record the original investigation, not a claim that the full erase proof now
verifies.

## Original violated invariant

A read of a pointer field that no step writes has one name before and after a
call that does not touch it. Since #1806 every C pointer read is an 8-byte
`LoadedPointer` read. Unfolding a composite resource still caches each pointer
field as two 4-byte `Int32` words
(`materialize_composite_resource_cells_from_snapshot` in
`src/surface/proof/resources.rs`: "Pointer fields keep the int32 words this
projection uses everywhere"). That rule fit the removed storage-relative
encoding, whose pointer read was a 4-byte word load. An 8-byte read cannot be
served from the two halves.

## Reproduction

`examples/rbtree/rbtree-erase/rbtree_erase_augmented.click` verified on master
`9415c258b` (just before #1806) and is refused on `1f9bde1fe`; the C and the
sidecar are unchanged:

```sh
cargo build --release --bin click
target/release/click verify examples/rbtree/rbtree-erase/rbtree_erase_augmented.click
```

```text
`solve` failed for `__rb_erase_augmented.contract`
could not establish `child->rb_right == at(transplant, child->rb_right)`
```

The step is line 694, after `step(__rb_change_child(node, successor, tmp, root), ...)`.
Before #1806 both sides lowered to one term and `normalize()` closed it.

What happens:

- At `transplant`, the read of `child->rb_right` takes its name from the cell
  cached at unfold, named at the entry snapshot.
- The call keeps `child->rb_right` in its retained frame. By design it forgets
  the cached cell (`CallHavocCellRule::KeptByCaller`), and a later load is named
  across the call edge.
- That naming walk (`cell_last_same_point`, assumption-free) reaches the
  pre-call state, finds only the two 4-byte halves, and keeps walking. It stops
  at the earlier store `rb_set_parent(tmp, successor)` through `node->rb_left`,
  which it cannot separate from `child + 8` without facts.

The kernel does prove the equality with facts. An explicit
`transport(at(transplant, child->rb_right) == at(transplant, child->rb_right), child->rb_right == at(transplant, child->rb_right)) using { };`
closes line 694. The same refusal then appears at line 738
(`have child->rb_right == at(transplant, child->rb_right) by auto();`).

The same cause probably explains two rbtree-augmented sidecars that already
failed before #1806 but now fail earlier:
`rbtree_size_insert_context_double_far_rotation.click` (a `solve` for
`node->rb_right == 0` at line 269, which `rewrite` plus `assumption` closed
before) and `rbtree_size_insert_mirrored_context_double_rotation.click`
(line 205). This is unconfirmed.

A small reduction (a store through `n->left`, then a call, then
`have child->right == at(before_call, child->right)`) passes on both
revisions; the trigger has not been isolated beyond the original proof.

## Attempted fix and what it exposed

Seeding a pointer field as one cell of the pointer type (in both the
struct-layout and the range branch of the function above) needs
`cell_value_is_exactly_load` in `src/kernel/proof/execution.rs` to accept a
pointer cell that holds the read its canonical load names. It still checks the
removed shape: same block, `Int32Scaled` load word. With both changes the lib
suite passes, but the corpus shows a spelling split:

- `symbolic_storage_cell_value` spells a pointer read as
  `Symbolic(load variable)` with the read as its designation; an ordinary load
  names it as the `LoadedPointer` itself.
- With whole pointer cells, the two spellings meet in one cell. Instance
  rewrite checking then fails with "the resource context is not the exchange
  its definition requires" (`mdtests/arena_prefix_free_reads_region_arena.md`,
  `mdtests/c_pointer_field_subrange_write_preserves_resources.md`, the arena
  example). An inner read in a range base's defining address is `Symbolic(v)`
  on one side and `LoadedPointer` on the other.
- `rbtree_erase_augmented.click` then stops earlier, at line 681 (`tmp == parent_model`).
- `mdtests/a_retained_pointer_field_fact_needs_its_listed_loop_alias.md`
  passes without its listed alias, which needs review before it is accepted.

The representation repair uses one spelling for a pointer read everywhere
(the `LoadedPointer` read), symbolic storage cells included, followed by whole
pointer cells. It also removes the obsolete pointer exclusion from the
same-source no-write rule: otherwise the newly complete cache entries are
mistaken for writes during transport. End-to-end proof work remains as listed
in the current status above.

## Acceptance criteria

- `rbtree_erase_augmented.click` verifies unchanged.
- An unfold caches a pointer field as one cell holding the read a load of it
  names, and the unfold naming check accepts exactly that value.
- A pointer read has one spelling, whatever produced its cell.
- `rbtree_size_insert_context_double_far_rotation.click` and
  `rbtree_size_insert_mirrored_context_double_rotation.click` fail no earlier
  than on `9415c258b`.
- A Markdown regression keeps the original pattern: a field cached by an
  unfold, a store through another pointer read, a call that retains the field,
  and a bare `have` equating the field's read before and after the call.
