# Verifier bugs

One `.md` file per reproduced soundness, proof-tooling, or diagnostic bug,
parallel to `issues/`: these are defects filed for a fixer rather than
roadmap milestones. Humans and agents file bugs here without asking; only the
user approves new entries in `issues/`. `AGENTS.md` defines what counts as a
bug, which includes inaccurate and wall-of-text diagnostics. Each file states
the violated invariant, a small intended regression, and acceptance criteria.
Delete a bug file when its fix, regression coverage, and documentation land.
