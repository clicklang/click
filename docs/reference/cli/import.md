# `click import`

Compiler imports let a sidecar verify the C selected by a configured compiler
preprocessor. Click still parses and lowers the resulting C and independently
checks its proofs. This mode is explicit and separate from the existing bounded
source-bundle preprocessor. The same command also refreshes the preliminary
typed C++ artifact described below.

```text
usage: click import lock <sidecar.click>
```

## Configure and lock an import

For `main.click`, create `main.click.import.json`. The configuration lists the
logical C sources named by the sidecar's `verifying` declarations, their compiler
inputs, and the output artifacts. For example:

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "target": "x86_64-linux-kernel",
  "compiler": "/usr/bin/gcc",
  "working_directory": ".",
  "environment": {
    "allow": {
      "PATH": "/usr/bin:/bin",
      "LC_ALL": "C",
      "SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH": "0"
    }
  },
  "sources": [
    {
      "logical_source": "main.c",
      "path": "main.c",
      "args": ["-DVARIANT=1", "-isystem", "configured"],
      "artifact": "main.i"
    }
  ]
}
```

The working directory is relative to the configuration file. Source and include
paths are interpreted in that working directory; artifact paths are relative
to the configuration file. Logical source paths identify translation units and
must match the sidecar, independently of the original header filenames used by
diagnostics.

Run `click import lock main.click` to create or explicitly refresh the configured
artifacts and `main.click.import.lock.json`. Then run `click verify main.click`.
The configuration's presence selects compiler mode for verification and its
associated proof tools. An invalid configuration or missing lock is an error;
it does not fall back to source-bundle mode.

Verification loads the recorded C artifact without executing or locating the
configured compiler. The artifact and version-2 lock can move to another host
with the same config bytes, C source, and project-local included headers. Loading
checks their hashes, the artifact bytes and size, the target, the recorded
toolchain/invocation identity, and the source projection identity. System
headers used during preparation are identified in the lock but need not be
installed on the verification host. A version-1 C lock must be refreshed.

This verifies the **prepared snapshot**. A change to the C source or an opened
project-local header is rejected during loading. A change to external headers,
or the appearance of a previously absent header selected by `__has_include`,
does not silently change that snapshot; run `click import lock` in the selected
toolchain environment to prepare a new one. The lock is a consistency record,
so publication and provenance of a native platform artifact still need a
trusted preparation process.

Lock creation is source preparation, not proof verification. The C parser can
still reject an unsupported construct when a proof tool loads the prepared
translation unit. No C declarations, function bodies, storage, attributes, or
assembly are silently deleted to make an import pass.

## Preliminary C++ semantic artifact

The preliminary C++ frontend boundary accepts one C++20 translation unit
selected by exactly one entry in a JSON compilation database, with one
selected free function or ordinary method and the uniquely named definitions
reachable from its supported direct call statements. In the baseline profile,
exceptions are disabled and every selected or reachable function must declare
`noexcept`. A second, deliberately smaller profile may retain the compilation
command's enabled exception mode: free functions and ordinary methods may omit
`noexcept`, but the closed reachable graph must contain only Click's checked
normal-returning operations. This profile permits borrowed trivial records,
while local object construction remains outside it.
The selected definitions may be written in the `.cpp` translation unit or in
one configured `.h` project header included by that translation unit. All
lowered declarations and source spans must come from that one logical source.
The linear reference fixture is:

```cpp
int increment(int& value) noexcept {
    value = value + 1;
    return value;
}
```

Its baseline import configuration explicitly sets `"language": "c++"`, the
standard to `c++20`, target to `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, exceptions and RTTI to false,
and paths for the pinned exporter, compilation database, working directory,
`.cpp` translation unit, logical source, selected function, and semantic
artifact. These booleans may also be true for a supported normal-only
reachable graph; the observed Clang profile must match the configuration.
`click import lock` executes the repository-owned Clang 19.1.7
LibTooling exporter with that entry and records the database bytes, exact parsed
command and directory, source, explicitly declared reachable-declaration
dependencies, every file Clang lexes while preprocessing the translation unit,
exporter, semantic profile, artifact, and configuration identities. Reachable
declaration spans outside the logical source must name one of the relative
dependencies. The broader preprocessor inventory also covers headers whose
declarations are not lowered. For each opened file the lock records its
accessed path, resolved target, and content hash. Refresh repeats the export
across a bounded inventory snapshot; offline loading rejects changed contents
or symlink targets without running Clang.
The configured working directory is also the dependency root: it may contain
the project source tree and a Linux sysroot while the selected CMake
compilation command runs in a separate build directory. Dependencies retain
paths relative to that root, not to the build directory. The Bitcoin Core
`MoneyRange` integration in `integrations/bitcoin-core-money-range/` uses this
arrangement on macOS.

```json
{
  "schema": 6,
  "language": "c++",
  "standard": "c++20",
  "target": "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",
  "exceptions": false,
  "rtti": false,
  "exporter": "target/cpp-exporter/click-cpp-exporter",
  "compilation_database": "compile_commands.json",
  "working_directory": ".",
  "source": "increment.cpp",
  "logical_source": "increment.cpp",
  "dependencies": [],
  "function": "increment",
  "artifact": "increment.cpp.click-cpp.json"
}
```

The database must resolve the configured translation unit to exactly one
command using the pinned Clang driver and the configured C++20, target,
exception, and RTTI profile. Missing or ambiguous entries and mismatched driver
or semantic profiles fail refresh locally. When `logical_source` names a
header, the importer resolves and hashes that file separately from the `.cpp`
translation unit. Offline loading rejects a missing or modified selected
header. Textually included project, sysroot, and Clang resource headers are
inventoried even when they lie outside the configured dependency root.
Response files, PCH, modules, VFS overlays, and arbitrary Clang pass-through
options are rejected because their hidden inputs are not inventoried.

For a compilation command with exceptions enabled, the config instead sets
`"exceptions": true`; the observed Clang profile must agree. The semantic
artifact records `exception_behavior: "normal_only"` independently from each
function's `declared_noexcept` value. This is not exception handling support:
reachable `throw`, `try`/`catch`, unresolved calls, and local object construction
are rejected locally. Borrowed references to the supported trivially destructible
record may use its checked fields and ordinary methods. Because the artifact contains the complete supported
direct-call closure and has no throwing operation, ordinary verification may
check its normal behavior without inventing an exceptional proof outcome.
An RTTI-enabled profile also permits those borrowed records; this does not add
virtual dispatch, `typeid`, or `dynamic_cast` semantics.

The separate `"exception_behavior": "scalar_int32"` config requires
`"exceptions": true`. Its locked artifact may contain a source `throw` of a
typed `int` payload in an object-free function; the importer lowers that node
to Click's checked exceptional statement outcome. A Click `throws int32`
signature must still declare the exception, and normal and exceptional
postconditions are proved separately. Reachable direct calls can propagate
that exception while normal scalar statements continue. One object-free
`try` with exactly one named by-value `catch (int name)` is also supported.
The handler binds the thrown payload and resumes from the thrown state, so a
caller can catch a verified helper's exception without declaring `throws`.
One narrow unwinding case is also supported: a `try` block may construct one
destructible automatic guard first, then call a potentially throwing helper.
Its public, non-virtual constructor and destructor must be explicitly
`noexcept`; the destructor runs on both normal and exceptional exits before
the handler observes state. The constructor's Click contract must establish
any object invariant required by the destructor that is not already available
from the checked execution state. The `cpp_one_guard_unwind` mdtest verifies
both outcomes.
The importer still rejects nested handlers, catch-all or non-`int` handlers,
other local declarations inside either block, multiple or late guards, returns
from a guarded `try`, `noexcept` free functions (whose termination behavior is
not modeled), and broader exceptional resource transfer. This is not general
C++ unwinding support or an exception-ABI proof. Clang's typed
source semantics and the compiler/runtime implementation remain the trust
boundary. The config, artifact, and lock keep
it distinct from both the exception-disabled baseline and exception-enabled
`normal_only` profile.

Loading through the C++ library boundary subsequently validates the translation
unit, selected logical source, compilation database, lock, and typed artifact
without locating or running Clang. This separation is intentional: compiler
execution belongs to explicit refresh. Changing either source or any command,
including a flag that leaves the selected AST unchanged, invalidates the lock.
The library lowers this exact artifact directly to the kernel execution
vocabulary without generating C text or invoking the C parser. An `int&` or
`const int&` becomes an address-valued parameter with its pointee qualification
preserved. Reads become typed loads, while only the mutable reference permits a
typed store; signed addition retains the kernel's existing overflow check. The
lowered value remains paired with the immutable semantic artifact so Clang
declaration identities and source spans are not discarded.

The first proof-facing interface uses existing Surface Click pointer syntax
for the reference's one-cell mutable view:

<!-- verified-example: examples/basic-cpp/increment.click -->
```click
verifying "increment.cpp";

int32 increment(int32* value) {
    requires value[0] < 2147483647;
    owns value[0..1];
    ensures value[0] == old(value[0]) + 1;
    ensures result == value[0];
} by {
    execute();
    simp();
}
```

This spelling does not translate the C++ body to C. The sidecar signature is
checked against the selected typed Clang declaration, while proof execution
uses its direct kernel lowering. `click verify`, `click profile`, `click
expand`, and `click audit` all load the same locked C++ input; verification and
rewritten-proof checks remain offline after refresh.

The sibling `branch-return` integration fixture additionally checks by-value
`bool`, a braced `if`, fallthrough, and an early return. The semantic artifact
retains the structured branch and both return edges; Click does not flatten it
into C text. The `const-reference-alias` fixture writes through an `int&` and
reads through an aliased `const int&`, using one explicit `owns` resource.
C++ `const` restricts access through that reference; it does not create a Click
`views` resource or imply that aliases cannot write. Supported parameters are
currently by-value `bool` or signed/unsigned 32/64/128-bit integers, `int&`, `const int&`,
mutable `int*`, one `const` signed-64 reference, and mutable or const references
to supported simple record types with distinct proof-facing names. Selected functions return `int`,
signed/unsigned 64/128-bit integers, `unsigned int`, `bool`, or `void`.

The `int64-predicate` fixture is the first narrow bridge toward Bitcoin Core's
`MoneyRange`: Clang retains the declaration identity and source span for a
direct `typedef long CAmount`, lowers `const CAmount&` as a const `int64*`,
retains the implicit `int`-to-signed-64 conversion of zero, and returns the
Boolean result of signed `>=`. Its exact all-input contract states the result
with a conditional expression and verifies offline:

<!-- verified-example: tests/fixtures/cpp-verification/int64-predicate/money_nonnegative.click -->
```click
verifying "money_nonnegative.cpp";

bool money_nonnegative(const int64* nValue) {
    owns nValue[0..1];
    ensures result == (if old(nValue[0]) >= 0i64 { 1 } else { 0 });
} by {
    if nValue[0] >= 0i64 {
        execute();
        simp();
    } else {
        execute();
        simp();
    }
}
```

The `constexpr-coin` fixture includes a pinned fixture-owned `<cstdint>`,
retains the ordered `CAmount` to `int64_t` alias chain across that locked
dependency, and imports one namespace-scope `static constexpr CAmount COIN =
100000000`. A reference to `COIN` carries its Clang declaration identity while
direct lowering uses its checked signed-64 evaluated value. The artifact also
retains the literal initializer and rejects disagreement between it and the
evaluated value. Offline loading needs neither Clang nor the exporter, but it
does rehash the declared header dependency.

The `constexpr-max-money` fixture extends that boundary to exactly one ordered
constant dependency: `MAX_MONEY = 21000000 * COIN`. The artifact retains both
declaration identities and the signed-64 multiplication tree, requires `COIN`
to precede `MAX_MONEY`, recomputes the result with checked multiplication, and
compares it with Clang's evaluated value. Direct lowering still substitutes the
validated `MAX_MONEY` value; it does not add runtime multiplication to the
kernel boundary. A second selected function in that fixture imports signed
64-bit `value <= MAX_MONEY`, retains the distinct Clang `<=` operator, and
lowers it directly to the kernel's inclusive signed comparison.
The third selection has the synthetic `value >= 0 && value <= MAX_MONEY`
shape. It retains Clang's built-in logical-and node and both comparisons,
then lowers to the kernel's left-to-right short-circuit operation with a
`bool` result. Its exact inclusive-range contract verifies offline; a false
upper-boundary contract fails.

These fixtures do not claim the host C++ standard library: their header is a
pinned input containing only the needed `int64_t` typedef. Mutable or
non-`constexpr` globals, undeclared header dependencies, broader or unordered
constant graphs, other constant expressions, mutable signed-64 references,
`!=`, `||`, and overloaded logical operators remain
outside the boundary. Signed integer operands in a Boolean context use the
checked nonzero conversion; they are not truncated to 32 bits first.

The `direct-call` fixture selects a caller and captures the transitive closure
of definitions reached by discarded-result direct call statements. Each call
node records the declaration identity resolved by Clang, reference arguments
retain their parameter identity, and all captured functions lower into the
ordinary modular call environment. Each definition has its own sidecar
contract and proof. The artifact rejects recursion, ambiguous reachable names,
and missing definitions. Reachable functions that omit `noexcept` are accepted
only in an exception-enabled normal-only profile (including borrowed trivial records); the baseline profile
continues to reject them. Omitting `noexcept` does not itself declare a Click
exception.

The `return-call` fixtures add direct `return helper(...)` for matching signed
or unsigned 32/64/128-bit and Boolean return types, including concrete function and
method template instances. The typed `return_call` node retains the callee's
Clang identity, typed arguments, result type, source span, and cleanup chain.
Implicit calls on `this` retain the existing checked receiver interface; arbitrary
pointer dispatch remains outside the slice. Lowering captures the result in a
fresh local of its actual type before destroying automatic objects, then returns
that captured value. The synthetic fee wrappers keep Bitcoin's direct method
return-call shape and signed fast-path results; the full upstream wide fallback
is still unsupported.

Regressions prove arbitrary scalar forwarding, branch results, memory framing,
Boolean and wide results before normal cleanup, and object-free normal/exceptional
propagation. Caller proofs agree across verification, expansion/reverification,
and retained audit. Artifact checks reject return-type mismatches, invalid call
graphs, and missing or misordered cleanups. Uncaught return-call cleanup edges
reuse the existing scalar exception lowering and have structural coverage;
resource-bearing exceptional contracts and returns from guarded `try` regions
remain outside the supported surface slice.

A direct free-function return call accepts one nested call argument, including
chains such as `return echo(echo(echo(value)));`. Other arguments must be stable
scalars: literals, locked compiler/constexpr constants, by-value scalar parameters
or scalar locals, and supported integer/Boolean casts of these values. Their
value cannot change across the nested call, and their evaluation is total, so
all C++ argument orders agree. Namespace-scope signed-64 `constexpr` constants
with internal linkage are accepted with or without explicit `static`, under the
existing bounded constant-graph checks. Concrete Boolean template substitutions
also retain their resolved constant value. Field reads and supported casts of
field reads are also admitted when the one nested call has only scalar value
inputs, with no reference/pointer arguments or further input calls. In this
closed profile, mutable globals and external calls are rejected, so such a
callee cannot acquire an alias to the caller's storage. Its field siblings are
checked and captured before the call; their values agree in every argument
order, and a throwing call cannot skip a read's authority check. This covers
`Div(Mul(fee, at_size), size, RoundDown)` with field-backed `fee` and `size`.
General alias analysis is not provided. Reference reads, dereferences,
arithmetic, additional calls, and side effects in sibling arguments fail import.
No unsafe sibling operation can be hidden by selecting an argument order that
skips it. Resource-bearing exceptional contracts remain outside the proof
surface slice.

Each nested result has a checked typed capture; an inner exception skips the
outer call and uses the return's cleanup edge. Verification, selected-caller
expansion/reverification, and retained audit cover all supported scalar types,
argument positions, casts, mixed-width branches, memory writes by the inner
call, normal destruction, and object-free exception propagation. Name allocation
and argument lowering have deterministic scaling coverage. Artifact validation
checks every nested callee, capture type, and sibling storage type and rejects
recursive graphs. Nested calls in integer-local initializers and discarded calls use the same
normalization and ordering checks as return calls. Calls in general value
expressions, converted call results, and returned references or objects remain
unsupported.

Scalar evaluation is normalized within the C++ frontend into explicit
statements followed by a typed value. Initializer and return artifact wrappers
retain source context; they do not select separate evaluation semantics.
The same ordering policy applies to integer-local initializer, return,
and discarded call arguments. Constructor arguments remain outside nested-call
support. Regressions cover scalar widths/signedness, initializer capture before
cleanup, exception propagation, unsafe siblings in each source position, and
verification/expansion/reverification/audit agreement.

The frontend also prepares contract-facing signatures, Clang layouts, and
local-object metadata alongside kernel execution. C++ and Rust feed the same
prepared execution package to the verifier, using the signature/layout
vocabulary shared with plain C. The shared verifier does not reinterpret C++
artifacts or re-traverse C++ bodies; the original source and locked semantic
identity remain attached to the prepared input.

The synthetic fee fixture preserves `Div(Mul(fee, at_size), divisor, round_down)`
and verifies concrete positive/negative rounding and exact division with
64-bit helpers. It rejects hostile rounding claims, zero divisors, and unproved
product bounds. This does not import upstream Bitcoin fee evaluation: its
`__int128`, `Assume` annotations, and field-reading sibling
arguments still need support.

The `scalar-local` and `signed-arithmetic` fixtures add mutable automatic signed/unsigned
32/64-bit integer locals declared directly
in the function body. Each local requires an initializer, which may be an
already-supported integer expression or a supported direct call. Local
declaration identity comes from Clang; direct-call initialization lowers to the
kernel's ordinary `Declare` and `CallAssign` statements, while later reads and
assignments use the existing scalar rules. This makes call results usable
without treating a compiler-resolved C++ expression as C source text.

The `pointer` fixture distinguishes a mutable `int*` parameter from an `int&`
in the Clang artifact. A caller may take the address of its mutable reference
parameter and pass that pointer to a direct call. Pointer lvalue-to-rvalue
conversion, `*pointer` reads, and `*pointer = value` writes lower to the
kernel's existing address, typed-load, and typed-store operations, so the
sidecar must provide ordinary memory authority. Removing that authority or
claiming the wrong pointer-mediated memory effect fails verification.

The `struct-member` fixture accepts one named, public, non-inheriting aggregate
`struct` whose fields are mutable `int`, signed 64-bit integers, or mutable `int*`. Clang supplies the
record and field declaration identities plus the exact LP64 size, alignment,
field offsets, and field widths. A function may receive an existing object by
mutable reference and read or write those fields with `object.field`; a pointer
loaded from a field may use the already-supported checked dereference rules.
The proof interface spells that reference as `struct Name*` and uses ordinary
field resources such as `owns state->saved`. Click does not reconstruct the
layout from C++ source or create a synthetic C body.

Static scalar methods use a distinct `static_method` artifact kind with their
class and declaration identities, without an implicit receiver or object-layout
requirement. Select an ordinary declaration with `Class::helper`; reachable
concrete function-template instances retain their existing distinct names.
Class-qualified and unqualified calls support the existing scalar initializer
and return-call positions, including one nested call with stable scalar siblings.
Parameters and results must be supported by-value integer or Boolean scalars.
Object-qualified static calls are rejected, including calls whose receiver has
side effects. Virtual dispatch and reference/pointer helper signatures remain
outside this slice. An unrelated unsupported field does not block a static
helper that never accesses object storage.

The synthetic `static-helpers.cpp` fixture preserves static `Mul`, `Div`, and
Boolean template forwarding, with positive and negative rounding proofs.
Selected-caller verification, expansion/reverification, and retained audit
agree. Regressions cover every scalar type, distinct classes, initializer calls,
scalar exception propagation, false claims, and malformed artifact identities
and signatures. This removes the static-helper prerequisite; Bitcoin's wide
arithmetic, checked `Assume`, and field-reading sibling arguments remain open.

The `value-methods` fixtures add non-static, non-virtual ordinary methods on
that record. Select a method with `"function": "FeeFrac::IsEmpty"` or
`"function": "FeeFrac::operator+="` (or `operator-=`). The proof interface names
them `FeeFrac_IsEmpty`, `FeeFrac_operator_add_assign`, and
`FeeFrac_operator_subtract_assign`, with an explicit first
parameter `self`. Const methods use `const struct FeeFrac* self`; const record
reference parameters retain the same qualification. This restricts writes
through that parameter without forbidding an alias through a mutable parameter.
Unused member functions, constructors, templates, and nested declarations are
not imported into the execution graph. Reachable definitions and the record's
complete supported field layout are still checked. Overloaded proof names and
reachable unsupported bodies fail import.

Direct `object.method(...)`, explicit `operator+=`/`operator-=`, and
`object += other`/`object -= other` calls bind that receiver to the selected declaration identity. Call arguments
must be direct supported references or the existing value arguments; pointer
receivers, virtual dispatch, other overloaded operators, and call results
outside the scalar-local initializer and direct scalar return-call slices remain unsupported.
Same-width signed field `+=` and `-=` use checked loads, arithmetic, and
stores. Compound updates with side effects or mixed-width conversions remain
unsupported. Overflow obligations apply to each field's
width. The fixtures prove disjoint-object addition, self-addition with one set
of field resources, and preservation of unrelated caller memory; they reject
false claims and missing authority or overflow bounds.

The [Bitcoin Core integration](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/integrations/bitcoin-core-money-range/README.md#fee-frac-value-methods)
verifies these same properties for unchanged upstream `FeeFrac` methods under
the real project profile. This does not prove the class's other methods or
its documented application invariant. The typed artifact schema is now 41;
previous artifacts require an explicit lock refresh.

The offline checker validates recursive function metadata before checking the
supported semantic profile. It checks source spans, declaration metadata, and
type-alias provenance and cycles throughout both branch arms, scopes, handlers,
initializers, calls, and cleanup lists. A malformed node inside an unsupported
lifetime arrangement reports a metadata error first. Supported widths, operand
types, lexical visibility, and cleanup ordering are checked separately; valid
metadata alone does not make a construct supported.

Artifact resource limits are independent of the supported C++ semantic profile:

| Budget | Limit |
| --- | ---: |
| Record declarations | 256 |
| Constant declarations | 1,024 |
| Function declarations, including the selected root | 1,024 |
| Call graph depth, including the selected root | 64 |
| Local declarations per function, including catch bindings | 1,024 |
| Cleanup scopes per function | 256 |
| Serialized JSON object/array nesting | 96 |
| Serialized JSON objects and arrays | 65,536 |
| Preprocessor files | 4,096 |

Exhaustion names the budget. Serialized bounds are checked before decoding;
the pinned exporter also bounds declaration discovery. Structural checks still
reject duplicate IDs, missing or mismatched references, invalid layouts, and
declarations outside the selected graph. Recursive calls remain unsupported
semantics. Acyclic constant forests may have multiple leaves and longer chains;
each initializer retains the supported literal-leaf or literal-times-prior-constant
form, and the checker independently recomputes every evaluated value. Multiple
record layouts reuse the existing field-type, explicit ABI, and ownership rules.
Local and scope budgets count both branch arms; parameters do not count as
local declarations. The exporter and checker enforce these counts independently.
Lifetime combination restrictions described below remain semantic-profile rules.

C++ graph validation indexes each function's parameter, local, and catch-binding
identities once. Reference arguments and destructor edges use borrowed type
lookups. Reusing a declaration ID anywhere in the function is rejected, including
across sibling scopes. Equal local names in disjoint scopes remain distinct
when their declaration IDs differ. Separate lexical and lifetime validation
checks visibility, construction, and cleanup order.

C++ calls and contracts bind through Clang declaration IDs. Unique readable
names are preserved; free namespace names replace `::` with `_`. If reachable
declarations share a readable name, each contract name is `__click_cpp_decl_`
plus the full lowercase hexadecimal UTF-8 declaration ID from the artifact.
This prefix is reserved: source declarations beginning with it also receive
encoded names, as do spellings that are not valid sidecar identifiers
(such as anonymous namespace members). The lowered-import API exposes
`contract_name(declaration_id)`.
Reachable overloads are supported; selecting an overloaded declaration directly
still fails until a signature selector is available.

A direct statement `__builtin_assume(condition)` creates a checked proof
obligation at its source location. The condition must be proved from contracts
or preceding control flow; the importer never inserts it as a trusted fact.
Lowering uses the common kernel's labeled assertion operation. A missing or
false condition fails verification even when the function's result claim would
otherwise hold. Normal returns and destructor cleanup remain unchanged.

Clang identifies the intrinsic by builtin declaration identity. An ordinary
function named `Assume` has ordinary call semantics. The builtin does not
evaluate its operand, so this slice accepts only total predicates over by-value
scalar parameters/locals and locked constants: supported casts, comparisons,
and logical conjunction. Reference/pointer/field reads, runtime calls, arithmetic,
and side effects are rejected. Compiler-folded constants retain the existing
pinned-Clang constant policy. Bitcoin's library `Assume` macro and general
assertion/abort behavior remain unsupported. Schema 37 requires an explicit
refresh of earlier locks.

Scalar interpretation is shared by the artifact validator, execution lowering,
and proof-facing signatures. It distinguishes mutable and const qualification
from the seven supported value kinds: Boolean, int32, int64, uint32, uint64,
int128, and uint128.
Integer literals use one checked parser in validation and lowering. Source
aliases preserve provenance without changing the value kind. Reference and
record-field restrictions remain specific to their positions in the profile.
Explicit integral casts use one C++ conversion policy over the common kernel;
the frontend does not re-infer promotions from source syntax.

The `signed-arithmetic` fixture lowers signed 32/64-bit `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`,
`%`, unary negation, and `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` into the common checked
kernel. Clang's integral promotions and signed casts are explicit artifact
nodes; mixed-width operands require those conversions. Signed 64-to-32
narrowing follows C++20's modulo semantics using the kernel's unsigned bit
conversion and signed reinterpretation. Boolean conversion preserves the
nonzero meaning of all 64 bits. Division truncates towards zero, and remainder
has the dividend's sign. Zero divisors and the `MIN / -1` and `MIN % -1`
overflow pair fail verification. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
negation retain their signed-overflow obligations. Scalar local call captures
require the same return width as the declaration; casts around calls remain
outside this slice.

The fixture preserves Bitcoin's quotient/remainder correction expression with
a signed 64-bit dividend. It checks both rounding directions for positive and
negative dividends, exact division, zero, signed extrema, and the largest
positive int32 divisor, together with expansion and retained audit sessions.
These are concrete rounding cases, not a general rounding theorem. General
quotient/remainder contracts and a modular caller with unrelated memory also
verify. Bitcoin's actual rounding helper still requires the remaining wide rounding
operations and conversion bounds described below.

The `wide-intermediates` fixture admits signed and unsigned `__int128` locals,
compiler constants, and Clang-resolved integral casts inside functions with the
existing 32/64-bit or Boolean signatures. C++20 casts use the shared modulo
conversion policy, and Boolean conversion observes all 128 bits. Signed wide
multiplication uses the shared checked runtime operation; casting a narrow
product afterwards cannot remove its original overflow obligation. High-bit
products, signed extrema, symbolic cast round trips, source-width overflow,
wide overflow, expansion, and retained audit have regression coverage.

The `scalar-braces` fixture admits one Clang-resolved integer or Boolean
brace initializer, including `__int128{a}` and `long value{n}`. It preserves
the semantic child's resolved conversion through the existing expression
model, including argument stability and compiler-assumption checks. C++
narrowing list initialization remains a compiler error; empty lists,
unsupported scalar widths, and unsupported effects remain refused. This
normalization adds no artifact node or schema version.

On a normal wide multiplication path, after both native range guards hold,
the shared kernel certifies the result's mathematical observation as the
exact Integer product. Pure Integer observation and capture retain the native
guards but do not demand that a certified result definition be supplied as
another assumption. False product claims and missing guards remain refused.

The `wide-contracts` fixture adds by-value wide parameters, results, and
matching-width call captures. Contracts spell these types `int128` and
`uint128`; `to_integer(value)` observes their full mathematical value.
`to_int128(z)` and `to_uint128(z)` require both exact destination bounds;
these proof conversions remain distinct from C++ modulo casts. Identities,
cast round trips, full signed/unsigned endpoints, modular calls with framed
narrow memory, expansion, and retained audit have regression coverage.
Bounded `simp` recognizes direct observer equalities; it does not currently
chain two Integer observer equalities through nested calls.

The `wide-division` fixture adds signed and unsigned 128-bit `/` and `%`.
Clang-resolved promotions remain explicit, including modulo conversion of a
negative narrow operand to unsigned 128 bits. Division truncates toward zero;
a nonzero remainder has the dividend's sign. Both operations require a nonzero
divisor. Signed operations additionally exclude `MIN / -1` and `MIN % -1`.
Contracts use `truncating_quotient(to_integer(a), to_integer(b))` or
`truncating_remainder(to_integer(a), to_integer(b))` for exact full-width
results. A signed contract can state the overflow exclusion as
`to_integer(a) != MIN or to_integer(b) != -1`, with the full Integer literal
for MIN. Missing guards and false results are refused, including for trivial
postconditions. Symbolic contracts, constants above 64 bits, modular caller
framing, offline verification, expansion, and retained audit have coverage.

The `wide-comparisons` fixture adds all six comparisons (`==`, `!=`, `<`,
`<=`, `>`, `>=`) on signed and unsigned 128-bit values. Comparison uses the
full mathematical observation with the operand's signedness; Clang-resolved
promotions remain explicit. The shared native and pure-spec condition
constructor keeps execution and retained branch proofs consistent. Boolean
contracts describe results as `0` or `1` and relate them to comparisons of
`to_integer(a)` and `to_integer(b)`. Exact premises and their complementary
relations settle known results without scanning unrelated proof facts.
Symbolic results, high-bit constants, mixed-width promotions, branches,
modular caller framing, offline verification, expansion, and retained audit
have regression coverage. Undefined operand arithmetic still fails even with
a trivial postcondition. `!=` is also admitted for the existing 32/64-bit
scalar profile.

The `wide-narrowing` fixture proves when existing C++ modulo casts preserve
full mathematical values. The explicit `integer_cast_identity` special
arithmetic certificate consumes two named constant-endpoint bounds on the
source observation, checking both against the destination range. Both signed
and unsigned 128-bit values narrow to signed/unsigned 32/64-bit results.
The rule also checks native quotient/remainder narrowing under their existing
definedness guards and stated result bounds. Out-of-range casts still wrap;
missing range premises, false results, and undefined operands are refused.
Modular caller framing, offline loading, expansion, and retained audit have
coverage. This adds proof support without changing the schema or trusting
conversion bounds. See [Integer certificates](../../internals/mathematical-integers.md#range-checked-modulo-cast-identities).

Wide pointers, references, record fields, arrays, negation,
addition, subtraction, and unsigned multiplication remain unsupported. Both
the live exporter and serialized artifact validator reject these operations.
Schema 40 requires refreshing older locks. The unchanged Bitcoin fee
division helper still needs quotient/remainder and narrowing bounds plus an
explicit treatment of the library `Assume` boundary. The unchanged
`FeeFrac::Mul` now has an exact product proof under explicit full-width
operand observer bounds in the
[Bitcoin integration](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/integrations/bitcoin-core-money-range/README.md#wide-fee-product).

Unsigned 32/64-bit scalar parameters, returns, locals, direct captures, and
same-type arithmetic/comparisons now use the common unsigned kernel types.
Addition, subtraction, multiplication and negation wrap modulo the width;
division and remainder require a nonzero divisor. Clang exports the usual
arithmetic conversions explicitly, so mixed signed/unsigned source expressions
retain their C++ meaning. Signed-to-unsigned conversion is modulo the target
width; unsigned-to-int32 narrowing reinterprets the low 32 bits. Uint32-to-int64
is an exact widening. C++20 uint64-to-int64 conversion preserves all 64 bits:
values through `INT64_MAX` retain their value, and higher values denote the
congruent signed value modulo 2^64. The importer selects the explicit kernel
`UInt64BitsToInt64` cast mode; ordinary C casts retain their existing checks and
supported slice. Subsequent signed operations retain overflow obligations.
Unsigned references and record fields, runtime narrow/wide integer types,
bitwise operations, and general templates remain outside this slice.

The `unsigned-arithmetic` fixtures check wraparound, extrema, casts, modular
caller framing, division guards, and both unsigned fee fast-path expressions.
Those fast-path cases return the unsigned intermediate and do not prove
upstream `EvaluateFee`. The kernel strengthens unsigned constant bounds using
only the queried endpoint's index, including negated bounds and values above
the signed sign bit; deterministic regressions grow unrelated fact populations.

The `signed-conversion` fixtures verify explicit and implicit conversions at
the sign bit and both extrema, both round trips for arbitrary inputs, a modular
bit-preservation contract with unrelated memory, and subsequent signed overflow.
They preserve the instantiated fee fast-path expressions and signed return type
and verify concrete rounding/boundary cases. The complete upstream `EvaluateFee`
implementation and a general rounding theorem remain open. Conversion proofs
agree across ordinary verification, expansion/reverification, and retained audit;
false signed results are rejected. The shared bitvector representation preserves
source bits and uses typed signed operators for subsequent computation. Indexed
bit-preserving equality rules have fact-population and expression-depth scaling
regressions.

The pinned Clang exporter evaluates constant `sizeof` expressions and static
zero-argument constexpr `std::numeric_limits::max()` calls in selected expression
positions. These produce distinct `compiler_constant` nodes with a checked
32/64/128-bit value/type and the original source span. The exporter preserves runtime
expression semantics under the pinned target and locked preprocessor input
closure. Standard-library semantics remain part of the trusted compiler input.
Runtime calls are never folded by this allowlist. General constexpr calls in
runtime expression positions, unsigned namespace constants, and local
call-capture initializer forms outside the ordinary call slice remain unsupported. The unchanged Bitcoin `GetSizeOfCompactSize` proof covers every
uint64 input in four disjoint ranges, checks expansion and retained audit, and
rejects false encoded-length claims. It proves encoded length, not serialized
bytes or a round trip.

Concrete function-template instances are supported when reached through an
ordinary selected caller and their instantiated operations fit the existing
profile. Boolean value arguments and unqualified builtin `bool`, `int`,
`unsigned int`, `long`, `unsigned long`, `long long`, and `unsigned long long`
type arguments are accepted. Each instance keeps its distinct Clang USR.
Sidecar names append argument tokens in order, such as `choose__bool_true`,
`identity__unsigned_long`, or `Value_select__bool_false`. Type aliases use the
canonical builtin token; equal-width types such as `long` and `long long`
retain different names. Name collisions remain explicit import errors.

For `if constexpr`, pinned Clang chooses the instantiated arm in constant
evaluation context. The artifact retains an ordinary constant Boolean `if`,
the selected arm, an empty discarded arm, and the original statement and
condition spans. The condition uses a distinct `compiler_constant` under a
Boolean conversion. Discarded code contributes no runtime calls, accesses,
or cleanup. A selected unsupported arm fails import. Ordinary `if` statements
continue to import both arms. Return validation checks the reachable arm of a
closed constant Boolean condition and both arms of an unknown condition.

The `template-instances` fixture checks modular callers, receiver authority,
framing, false contracts, same-width type identities, Boolean substitution,
constant-evaluation context, and unsupported arguments. Its instantiated fee
fast paths retain the unsigned expressions and cover both rounding directions
with expansion/reverification and retained audit. They remain synthetic
prerequisite proofs, not verification of upstream `EvaluateFee`. Selecting a
dependent template pattern, packs, other non-type arguments, class templates,
qualified or non-scalar type arguments, and calls in unsupported expression
positions remain outside this slice. Template substitution and constexpr
selection are trusted compiler operations under the locked input profile;
selected function implementations still require verified sidecar contracts.

The shared signed-64 reasoning rules also verify `x + z` and `x - z` across
the full signed range when a modular helper establishes `z == 0`. They retain
the equality's proof provenance, read only the queried operands' fact indexes,
and strip chains of zero additions through borrowed operands. Deterministic
regressions check unrelated fact populations and increasing expression depth;
the C `int64_returned_zero_identity` fixture covers the common kernel path.

The `local-aggregate` fixture declares one automatic object of that same record
kind directly in a function body. It must use direct braces with exactly one
initializer for every field in declaration order. The artifact binds those
expressions to Clang field identities, and direct lowering allocates the exact
Clang layout as kernel stack memory before applying typed field stores. Later
`object.field` reads use the same checked offsets as an existing object passed
by reference; trivial scope exit needs no destructor action.

The `constructor-local` fixture permits that one automatic object to use one
public, explicit, non-default `noexcept` constructor. Its member-initializer
list must initialize every field in declaration order; the constructor body
and its implicit call at the declaration are both lowered and verified through
the ordinary modular call rules.

The `terminal-destructor` fixture adds one public, non-virtual, non-deleted,
explicitly `noexcept` destructor with a nonempty supported body. The artifact
records its declaration identity on the record and records its implicit call
as cleanup on the function's single final return. Direct lowering first
captures the return expression in an internal scalar local, then calls the
checked destructor, then returns the captured value. The fixture proves that
the destructor restores caller memory while the result retains the value seen
before cleanup; missing and false destructor contracts are rejected.

Lifetime planning derives each destructor from the typed local and record
identity, independently of the artifact's cleanup lists. A scoped construction
stack supplies cleanup for returns, lexical fallthrough, and exceptional exits;
validation checks that exported lists match the live objects in reverse order.
An initializer's exceptional continuation never activates its destination.
Catch boundaries delimit unwinding, while returning captures the result before
destruction. This replaces arrangement-specific lowering and final-return-based
destructor discovery. Constructors remain nonthrowing in this profile; partial
construction, temporaries, copy/move, and wider exceptions remain unsupported.

The `early-return-destructor` fixture permits structured `if` statements after
one destructible object has been constructed directly in the function body.
Every return edge captures its result and then invokes that same checked
destructor. It verifies the original two-path `Restore` example: the early path
returns 7, the final path returns 9, and both restore the referenced integer to
its entry value. Returns before construction carry no cleanup for the future
object. The `construction_prefix` fixture also returns between two constructions;
each return destroys only its successfully constructed prefix.
The `examples/basic-cpp/` project also selects a modular caller starting with
41: either captured result is retained while the referenced cell is 41 after
the call.

Multiple top-level objects are supported when all require destruction and use
the supported constructor and destructor, within the local declaration budget.
The `reverse-destructor-order` fixture demonstrates two objects. Both objects
are activated individually after successful initialization. A return after both
constructions records the second object's
destructor before the first object's destructor, and lowering checks those
calls in that order. The fixture makes the ordering observable: the second
guard restores 7 before the first guard restores the caller's entry value.

The `nested-scope-destructor` fixture alternatively permits one explicit block
directly in a free-function body. Such a block may contain multiple directly
constructed destructible objects, within the declaration budget, and no other
block locals. The fixture demonstrates one object. A return from the block captures
its value before running the destructor, while normal fallthrough runs the
same checked cleanup before the next outer statement. The artifact retains
that lexical boundary as a `scope` statement; the outer return consequently
has no cleanup for the already-destroyed object.

Sibling blocks are supported within the cleanup-scope and declaration budgets
when their object lifetimes do not overlap. The `sibling-scope-destructors`
fixture demonstrates two such blocks. Each sibling carries its own return and
fallthrough cleanup, and the next block begins only after the preceding
destructor. The fixture deliberately reuses the source name `guard`; distinct
Clang declaration identities and the kernel's sequential local-lifetime rule
keep those objects separate.

The `overlapping-scope-destructors` fixture instead composes exactly one outer
destructible object with exactly one inner cleanup scope. A return from the
inner scope records the inner destructor before the outer destructor. Normal
fallthrough destroys only the inner object, and the final function return then
destroys the still-live outer object. The proof makes the order observable by
checking that both paths return the value restored by the inner guard while the
outer guard ultimately restores caller memory. Conditional construction,
deeper blocks, shadowing between the two live objects, a second inner scope,
and broader overlapping lifetimes remain rejected.

The `conditional-construction` fixture permits exactly one top-level `if` to
contain one cleanup scope in one otherwise-empty arm. The object's constructor
and destructor occur only on that arm: an early return destroys the object,
normal arm fallthrough destroys it before the outer continuation, and the
skipped arm plus final return carry no cleanup. The destructor contract has a
precondition established by construction, so verification would reject a
destructor synthesized on the path where no object exists. Objects in both
arms, combination with another aggregate or cleanup scope, and deeper
conditional construction remain rejected.

Copies and moves, default or partial aggregate initialization, multiple
non-destructible aggregate locals, broader nested lifetime combinations,
virtual dispatch, inheritance, private fields, bit-fields, nested record values,
and same-named record layouts remain explicit errors.
Uninitialized or nested scalar locals, local references, shadowing,
address-taking other than a current mutable reference parameter for a supported
pointer call, pointer locals, pointer arithmetic, null pointers, multiple
indirection, call results outside the supported initializer and return-call slices,
indirect calls, loops,
external specifications, and broader C++ syntax also remain outside this
end-to-end subset.

## Validation and supported profile

Explicit refresh runs preprocessing with controlled arguments and environment,
records the selected toolchain, dependencies, source and artifact, and refuses
inputs that change during preparation. Ordinary loading does not invoke the
compiler. It checks the lock's internal identities and the available project
inputs against the recorded snapshot. Changed C sources, opened project-local
headers, configuration, or artifact bytes cannot reuse that lock. External
toolchain and header changes require a new explicit refresh to produce a proof
about that new environment. A supplied digest alone does not authenticate who
prepared a native-platform artifact.

Compiler-backed C imports accept two explicit targets. The config target must
match the sidecar's `target` directive; an omitted directive selects the kernel
target. Prepared imports retain their target through verification and expansion.

| Target | Fixed compiler profile |
| --- | --- |
| `x86_64-linux-kernel` | GCC, `-x c`, `-std=gnu11`, `-m64`, `-funsigned-char`, `-nostdinc`. |
| `x86_64-linux-userspace` | GCC, `-x c`, `-std=c11`, `-m64`, `-funsigned-char`, `-nostdinc`, `-pthread`, `-D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L`. |

The user-space profile checks C11, POSIX and pthread feature macros as well as
the LP64, eight-bit-byte, unsigned-char ABI. It does not define `__KERNEL__`.
Configuration cannot override its fixed standard or profile macros. Target and
invocation identities distinguish locks even when the emitted C is identical.
Selecting this profile grants no pthread contract or concurrency semantics.

Both profiles require explicit include directories: `-nostdinc` disables
ambient system include search. Supply the selected toolchain and libc header
roots with ordered `-isystem` or `-I` arguments; those roots and opened headers
participate in the preparation inventory and lock identity. For the selected
Debian GCC 12 environment, these roots are `/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/12/include`,
`/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu`, and `/usr/include`. Other installations must
supply their actual selected roots. Lock preparation may succeed while Click's
C parser still refuses an unsupported declaration in a real system header.

Configured forced includes and ordered `-D` and `-U` options select additional
preprocessing inputs. Other compiler options are rejected unless a named option
profile, described below, lists their exact spelling. Response files, plugins,
and execution hooks are always rejected. The compiler runs with a cleared environment;
only the configuration's supported variables are supplied. Use explicit
`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` when source depends on date/time macros.

Compiler invocation has output and time bounds, and failure or cancellation
stops its owned process group. Partial compiler output cannot become a
validated artifact. Dependencies come from the compiler's complete dependency
output, including configured system headers; source-map filenames are not a
substitute for that inventory.

The initial implementation snapshots the working directory, source directories,
and configured include roots before and after preprocessing. Keep them quiescent
during lock refresh. Root/configuration/output paths with symlink components are
rejected during preparation; dependencies resolving outside the declared roots
are also rejected. Output parent directories must already exist. A project is
limited to 512 MiB and 200,000 entries in its input-root inventory, 64 MiB per
artifact, 128 MiB of combined artifacts, and 1 MiB each for its configuration
and lock. Compiler
processes have a 30-second limit. Exceeding a limit is a diagnostic, never a
partial successful import.

Compiler imports initially reject incremental `--changed-since` requests and
do not use verification markers. Their proofs are checked through the same
engine used for ordinary verification, profiling, audit, and expansion.

### Option profile `linux-6.8-x86_64-kbuild`

A configuration may set `"option_profile"` to a named option profile. The
profile admits further options beside the preprocessing options above, and
only for its target. The lock records the profile name beside each source's
complete argument vector, and loading refuses a lock whose profile differs
from the configuration's.

The one profile, `linux-6.8-x86_64-kbuild`, is the option set of the recorded
Linux v6.8.12 `x86_64_defconfig` Kbuild compilation of `lib/rbtree.c` with
GCC 13, for the `x86_64-linux-kernel` target. It exists for that in-repository
import. An option is accepted only where ignoring it cannot make Click accept
a program the compiler treats differently: the option affects only
preprocessing, whose result is the locked artifact, or only diagnostics, or
only code generation, or it makes the compiler's semantics stricter than
Click's or no weaker. The list is closed and keyed to exact spellings. A
different value, an unlisted sibling, or an unknown option is refused with its
source and argument position, for example
``source `lib/rbtree.c`: unsupported compiler argument 50 `-O3`; ...``. Some
options are accepted only beside others that make them safe; without them the
option is refused with the missing one named.

Besides `-E` and the source operand, which the importer supplies itself, the
recorded vector has 102 options: 15 base preprocessing options, 4 that the
target fixes, and 83 others with 79 distinct spellings. All 79 are accepted:
`-mno-sse` and `-mno-sse2` only beside `-mno-80387`, and `-O2` only beside
`-fno-strict-aliasing`, `-fno-strict-overflow`, and
`-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks`, with the optimizer promises below refused
in the imported source.

| `-fno-strict-aliasing` | Accepted | Removes GCC's type-based alias assumptions; Click never assumes them, and refuses accesses that do not fit the cell. |
| `-fno-strict-overflow` | Accepted | Makes signed and pointer overflow wrap; Click treats both as undefined, which is stricter. |

| `-ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero` | Accepted | Zeroes uninitialized automatic storage; Click refuses any read of uninitialized storage. |

| `-mno-3dnow` | Accepted | Restricts instruction selection; no floating-point evaluation change. |

| `-mno-sse` | Accepted with `-mno-80387` | Alone it moves floating point to the x87 with excess precision (`__FLT_EVAL_METHOD__` 2), which Click does not model. |
| `-mno-sse2` | Accepted with `-mno-80387` | Alone it moves `double` to the x87 with excess precision (`__FLT_EVAL_METHOD__` -1), which Click does not model. |
| `-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3` | Accepted | Stack alignment only; GCC realigns frames that need more. |
| `-mskip-rax-setup` | Accepted | Variadic-call register setup only. |
| `-mtune=generic` | Accepted | Instruction scheduling only. |
| `-O2` | Accepted with `-fno-strict-aliasing`, `-fno-strict-overflow`, `-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks` | Optimization preserves the meaning of a program without undefined behavior, which is what Click proves; GCC's remaining unchecked assumptions are refused in the source (see "Optimizer promises"), and `__builtin_constant_p` is an unknown 0 or 1. |

### Optimizer promises

Under an option profile that accepts optimization, the frontend refuses, with
the attribute's location and the reason, every attribute and qualifier that
GCC's optimizer trusts as a promise from the programmer, because Click does not
check those promises. Without such a profile, GCC 13 does not act on them and
they are accepted and ignored as before.

| Construct | Under `linux-6.8-x86_64-kbuild` | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nonnull` | Refused | GCC deletes the parameter's null checks, even with `-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks`. |
| `const` | Refused | GCC merges calls and assumes the function touches no memory. |
| `leaf` | Refused | GCC assumes the call leaves the unit's unescaped static data unchanged. |
| `access` | Refused | A promise about how the pointed-to object is accessed; not observed exploited by GCC 13, but unchecked. |
| `noreturn` | Refused, except on `compiletime_assert`'s block-scope `error` declaration | GCC emits nothing after the call. Every call to an `error` declaration lowers to a check that fails on any path reaching it, so Click proves it unreachable. |
| `returns_twice` | Refused | A second return needs a control-flow model Click does not have. |
| `restrict` | Refused | GCC assumes restrict pointers do not alias. |
| `pure`, `returns_nonnull`, `malloc`, `alloc_size`, `alloc_align`, `assume_aligned` | Refused in every mode | Unchecked promises the frontend never accepted. |
| `__builtin_unreachable`, `__builtin_assume`, `assume` statement attribute | Refused in every mode | Unchecked promises the frontend never accepted. |
| `cold`, `hot`, `noinline`, `warn_unused_result`, `nonstring` | Refused in every mode | Harmless to the optimizer's semantics (layout, inlining, and diagnostics only), but not supported by the frontend. |
| `always_inline`, `gnu_inline`, `nothrow`, `weak`, `deprecated`, `unused`, `no_instrument_function` | Accepted | Inlining choice, linkage, or diagnostics; C has no exceptions for `nothrow` to promise about. |
| `__builtin_expect` | Accepted | A branch-probability hint; its value is its first operand. |

The list comes from GCC 13's attribute documentation and from these
measurements with the recorded `x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc-13`. Each lying
declaration is in a separate object file, so GCC cannot see the body, and each
program prints the same values at `-O0` and differs at `-O2` with the three
safety options:

- `nonnull(1)` on a definition with `if (!p) return -1;`: `-O0` returns -1
  for a null argument, `-O2` dereferences it and crashes.
- `const`, and `pure` on a function that increments a counter: two calls
  differ by 1 at `-O0`, and by 0 at `-O2`.
- `leaf` on a function that calls back into the unit and changes a static
  variable: `-O0` sees the change, `-O2` does not.
- `noreturn` on a function that returns: `-O0` continues after the call,
  `-O2` runs off the end of the caller and crashes.
- `restrict` parameters passed the same address: `-O0` reads the second
  store, `-O2` the first.
- `malloc` on a function returning an existing object's address: `-O2`
  misses the store through the result.
- `assume_aligned(16)` on a misaligned pointer: `-O2` folds the low bits to 0.
- `__builtin_unreachable` and `assume` statement attributes: `-O2` folds
  the condition they assert.
- `returns_nonnull` returning null: the check is deleted at `-O2` without
  `-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks` and kept with it.
- `access(read_only, 1)` on a function that writes, and `__builtin_expect`:
  no difference.

GCC does not assume that loops terminate when compiling C (`-ffinite-loops`
is off), and `-O2` otherwise exploits only undefined behavior, such as
signed overflow, null or out-of-bounds access, and reads of uninitialized
storage, which Click refuses to prove. The three safety options turn off the
remaining assumptions Click does not make: type-based aliasing, overflow, and
null-check deletion.

## Dependency-closure projection

A source entry may set `"projection": "dependency-closure"`. Click then
imports only part of the locked artifact: every function definition written
in the translation unit's own source file (the file the first line marker
names), and, transitively, every file-scope declaration that defines a name a
kept declaration mentions. That includes types, struct, union, and enum tags,
enumeration constants, typedefs, objects, prototypes, and inline helpers.
Everything kept is parsed, lowered, and checked as usual, so an unsupported
construct inside the closure is still rejected with its original location.
Declarations outside the closure are not parsed, and nothing is claimed about
them.

Two rules keep the omission checked rather than permissive:

- An exact `extern typeof(f) f;` redeclaration is never needed to type a use
  of `f`, because it repeats `f`'s own type with nothing added. The Linux
  `EXPORT_SYMBOL` macro emits one per exported function, beside its export
  storage and `.export_symbol` assembly, which nothing names. Export storage
  and export assembly are therefore outside the claim.
- If an omitted declaration carries the `constructor` or `destructor`
  attribute, the projection is refused, because such a function runs
  without being named.

Every other declaration that defines a needed name is kept, including
redeclarations that add attributes such as `weak`. Omitted declarations are
blanked in place, so line numbers and original-source locations are
unchanged. The option is part of the import configuration and therefore of
the lock's identity.

This is a bounded arrangement for importing one kernel translation unit
whose headers declare far more than its functions use. It is not a general
statement that omitted header declarations are harmless, and it does not
validate them.

## Locations and trust boundary

Structured compiler line markers preserve original filenames and line numbers
through parsing and lowering. Physical artifact positions remain available for
debugging. Textual markers do not provide full macro-expansion backtraces or
exact original columns inside expanded macros; diagnostics do not claim that
precision. A system-header marker does not suppress errors or omit code.

The compiler preprocessor is a trusted dependency for source selection.
Reproducing its invocation is not a formal proof that its preprocessing is
correct. It supplies neither executable C semantics nor proof authority to
Click: those remain in Click's frontend and independent kernel checker.

The captured Linux 6.8.12 rbtree translation unit is locked in
`integrations/linux-rbtree/`. Its configuration selects the
`linux-6.8-x86_64-kbuild` option profile and the dependency-closure
projection. Its full header graph includes unsupported C forms, effectful
assembly, and storage-producing exports, which the projection leaves out. The
lock and artifact load offline once the checked input closure is extracted;
no proof runs against the imported bodies yet.

## Options and exit status

`--help` and `-h` show usage. `--` ends option parsing before a positional path.
A successful lock operation exits 0. Invalid configuration, missing inputs,
compiler failure, an exceeded bound, or an output-write failure exits nonzero
with a diagnostic. Ordinary verification never rewrites a lock or artifact.


C++ imports may explicitly assume a narrow external library assertion contract
with the optional `library_assertions` config field. For example (replace the
hash with the SHA-256 of the actual header bytes):

```json
"library_assertions": [{
  "kind": "checked_boolean_statement",
  "function": "library::check",
  "header": "gate.h",
  "sha256": "<64 lowercase hexadecimal digits>"
}]
```

The header must be in the explicit `dependencies` inventory and the locked
preprocessor closure. Entries have unique, sorted qualified function names;
the inventory is limited to 64. Header hashes are checked during refresh and
offline loading. The resolved callee declaration, and its definition when
present, must belong to that header. Config, artifact, compiler command, and
input closure are part of the import identity. A changed pin requires an
explicit config edit and lock refresh.

This is an **assumed library contract**, not verification of its implementation.
It states that, when its Boolean argument is true, the call returns normally
without changing caller-visible memory. Each admitted call evaluates that
argument and generates an obligation to prove it true. It neither adds an
unproved condition to the proof context nor admits the library's false-input,
abort, or exception behavior. The diagnostic names the contract and header
hash; normal cleanup still runs. A function merely named `Assume` retains
ordinary call semantics without a matching explicit contract.

The first slice accepts only a direct standalone discarded-result call to a free,
non-template, non-variadic function with one Boolean value parameter and a
void or Boolean value return type. Its argument must be a total scalar
Boolean condition without memory reads, mutation, calls, or partial arithmetic.
Reference parameters or returns, metadata arguments, temporary-object cleanup,
and using the result are unsupported. In particular, Bitcoin's evaluated
`inline_assertion_check<false>` with source-location and string-view arguments
remains rejected. It needs a further explicit contract slice for those
arguments; it is not Clang's unevaluated `__builtin_assume`.
