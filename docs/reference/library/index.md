# Standard library

The Click standard library is the public Surface Click API loaded from
`stdlib/prelude.click` with every user sidecar. It isn't the Rust crate's
internal `pub` API.

Every declaration below is copied exactly from the prelude and checked by the
documentation gate. The same gate compares declaration names bidirectionally,
so adding, removing, or changing a public symbol requires a matching reference
update.

Pure function calls remain symbolic until explicitly unfolded. Predicates
remain opaque until a proof explicitly unfolds them or applies a theorem that
exposes the needed consequence. Theorems can be applied when their stated
requirements are available. An abstract resource has no body to unfold.

## Mutex acquisition authority

### `mutex_guard`

```click
abstract resource mutex_guard(mutex: void*);
```

**Meaning:** Owns one current acquisition of a modeled mutex. The built-in
resource has exclusive unit ownership, no view, and no memory authority.
Use `owns mutex_guard(mu)` inside a declared-resource body. Folding consumes
the existing guard and unfolding returns it; proving `held(mu)` cannot create
it. Contracts may preserve a direct `owns mutex_guard(mu)` input or a folded
guard-bearing instance. Independently checked helpers can unfold and refold
wrappers, but cannot change mutex protocols. Direct clauses return the entry
acquisition. Named primitive binders and consumed/produced guards remain
unsupported.

**Verified use:** [`mdtests/mutex_guard_resource_body.md`](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/mdtests/mutex_guard_resource_body.md).

## Mutex lifecycle authority

### `mutex_live`

```click
abstract resource mutex_live(mutex: void*);
```

**Meaning:** Owns the lifecycle authority for one initialization of a modeled
mutex. Initialization creates this exclusive unit resource. Locking currently
requires it to be available; destruction consumes it. A previous initialization's
owner cannot authorize operations after reinitialization at the same address.
It supplies neither an acquisition nor memory access, and cannot be viewed or
counted.

Use `owns mutex_live(mu)` directly in a preserving contract or inside an
exclusive declared-resource body. Folding consumes the owner; unfolding returns
it. Preserving helpers retain the entry initialization and cannot change mutex
protocols. Missing authority is reported as `Requires owns mutex_live(mu)`.

Initialization requires owned, aligned storage and reserves it against ordinary
writes until destruction. Synchronous helpers can borrow lifetime permission
through `mutex_use`. Worker transfer, named primitive binders, and lifecycle
`consumes`/`produces` contracts remain unsupported.

Automatic objects containing initialized mutexes cannot leave scope until
those mutexes are destroyed, even when their authority is folded away. This
covers normal and abrupt scope exits. Ambiguous symbolic mutex pointers are
refused conservatively rather than assumed separate from local storage.

**Verified use:** [`mdtests/mutex_live_wrapper.md`](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/mdtests/mutex_live_wrapper.md)
and [`mdtests/mutex_live_contract.md`](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/mdtests/mutex_live_contract.md).

## Borrowed mutex lifetime

### `mutex_use`

```click
abstract resource mutex_use(mutex: void*);
```

**Meaning:** An owned permission to use an initialized mutex while its caller
retains lifecycle responsibility. Use `owns mutex_use(mu);` in a preserving
helper contract. Calls borrow an available `mutex_live(mu)` owner or reborrow
an existing use permission; returning restores that exact source. A helper's
input grants neither lifecycle ownership nor protected-memory access.

The current implementation supports synchronous preserving helpers and nested
calls, including contracts with ordinary owned memory and stable views. It
retains the protocol freeze: initialization, destruction, acquisition, and
release inside these helpers remain unsupported. `views`, quantities, named
primitive binders, consumed/produced use permissions, and worker transfer are
also unsupported. Missing call-site authority is reported as
`Requires owns mutex_use(mu)`.

**Verified use:** [`mdtests/mutex_use_contract.md`](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/mdtests/mutex_use_contract.md)
and [`mdtests/mutex_use_mixed.md`](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/mdtests/mutex_use_mixed.md).

## Population authority

### `authority`

```click
abstract resource authority();
```

**Meaning:** `authority(reference(p))` is the exclusive control resource for
one population of the declared resource type `reference(p)`. The empty
population may be established with `fold(authority(reference(p)))` only in the
execution proof that created `p`'s storage. It may be retired with
`unfold(authority(reference(p)))` only when its member count is zero. Its
members may be field-free with private owned memory, observed by their current
`count(...)` and moved by direct authority/member helper contracts. An
ordinary field-free control can package counter memory, authorities, and facts
relating the memory to population counts. Ordinary helper contracts transfer
these controls, concrete members, and checked symbolic groups.

Local families can also have C or integer proof fields. For example,
`authority(ticket(p))` governs separately named `ticket(p)` instances; their
identities and field values remain distinct even when their arguments agree.
`let first = fold(ticket(p), { serial: 1 });` creates one member, and
`unfold(first)` consumes that exact member. Both operations require the matching
owned authority. `count(ticket(p))` observes the population total, not field
values or ownership of individual members. Retirement requires zero members.
A wildcard authority such as `authority(ticket(pool, _))` governs all exact
arguments of that local family. Both aggregate and exact counts include separate
occurrences with equal arguments. Private bodies remain exclusive even when
instances share their family arguments.

Preserving helpers take a named member through ordinary `owns` contracts and
retain its proof fields through explicit postconditions. They can unfold and
restore its private body while the caller keeps the authority control closed;
the same population occurrence stays reserved across the preserving call. A
member alone does not permit observing `count(...)`. Verified helpers can
create or consume named members when their checked input partition supplies the
governing authority. Creation needs an increment bound; consumption needs the
exact owned occurrence. Unary and wildcard imports preserve arbitrary entry
totals and record relative effects without anonymous member rights. Assumed
interfaces may preserve named ownership but cannot perform these lifecycle
effects. Symbolic quantities of heterogeneous named instances remain unsupported.

**Verified use:** [`mdtests/authority_named_field_private_helper.md`](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/mdtests/authority_named_field_private_helper.md).

**Verified use:** [`authority_control_wrapper_tracks_memory_and_member_count_through_open_scopes`](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/src/surface/tests/authority_private_body_tests.rs).

A count and an equal C counter can have different checked term representations.
To transfer increment definedness, explicitly rewrite the count to the counter
using the control's equality and establish the nonnegative bound as needed.
For example, `rewrite(count(item(pool, _)) == pool->checked_out)` can transport
`defined(pool->checked_out + 1)` inside an opened control. Nonnegativity alone
does not establish increment safety: the count can still be `2147483647`.

**Verified use:** [`authority_count_defined_through_control.md`](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/mdtests/authority_count_defined_through_control.md)
and [`authority_count_defined_at_max_rejected.md`](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/mdtests/authority_count_defined_at_max_rejected.md).

## Allocation authority

### `allocation`

```click
abstract resource allocation(base: int32*, bytes: int32);
```

**Meaning:** Owns the lifetime authority for the heap allocation whose base pointer is `base` and whose extent is `bytes`. The resource is abstract and cannot be unfolded.

**Kind:** abstract resource. Parameter types, requirements, and guarantees are normative in the declaration above.

**Verified use:** [`mdtests/stdlib_every_symbol.md`](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/mdtests/stdlib_every_symbol.md) exercises this symbol and is checked by the ordinary mdtest gate.

## Natural numbers

`Nat` is an ordinary recursive logical datatype: `Zero` and `Succ(Nat)`.
Its values are mathematical naturals, with no machine-width bound or wrapping.
Unknown naturals remain symbolic; they are not eagerly built as successor chains.
Addition is a pure recursive definition with checked induction proofs, not a new
kernel arithmetic primitive. Checked `to_integer` and `to_nat` conversions are
available; this slice does not add numeral sugar or implicit conversions to C
integers.

### `Nat`

```click
spec enum Nat {
    Zero,
    Succ(Nat),
}
```

**Verified use:** [`mdtests/stdlib_nat.md`](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/mdtests/stdlib_nat.md).

`to_integer(n)` observes a `Nat` as an exact Integer. `to_nat(z)` requires
`z >= 0` and remains symbolic even for large values. These conversions have
checked builtin meanings; the ordinary recursive `nat_to_integer` function
is independent. The laws below relate the two domains without coercions.

    ensures to_integer(Nat::Zero) == 0;

## Lists

`List<T>` is an immutable logical value, not a C layout or ownership resource.
It preserves order and multiplicity. Use explicit constructors and the functions
below; `[]`, `++`, and `in` still use the older sequence representation.

spec enum List<T> {
    Nil,
    Cons(T, List<T>),

    decreases xs
{

            if head == value { 1 } else { list_contains(tail, value) },
    }
}
```

Returns `1` for membership and `0` otherwise, using element equality.
Its checked laws support C scalar, pointer, and algebraic-valued elements,
including nested lists. Comparisons of unknown algebraic values stay symbolic.

```

Bounds on the mathematical difference establish that signed C subtraction
does not overflow. It is the subtraction twin of
`int32_add_defined_by_integer_bounds`, and both bounds are likewise required.
When constant bounds on the operands themselves suffice, the checked
`int32_defined` certificate step needs no `to_integer` conversion

    ensures to_integer(left + right) == to_integer(left) + to_integer(right);
}
```

Unsigned machine addition agrees with mathematical addition when the mathematical sum fits `uint32`. Unsigned definedness alone allows wrapping and cannot establish this equality.

**Verified use:** [`mdtests/stdlib_every_symbol.md`](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/mdtests/stdlib_every_symbol.md).

### `uint32_subtract_to_integer`

theorem uint32_subtract_to_integer(left: uint32, right: uint32) {
    requires right <= left;
    ensures to_integer(left - right) == to_integer(left) - to_integer(right);
}

```

**Meaning:** Proves that two nonnegative lengths with the same null-free prefix
condition and null terminator for one byte array are equal. It is a pure
content theorem; it does not grant viewability or read/write permission.

**Kind:** theorem. The proof is checked as part of the standard-library
definition and its requirements and guarantee are normative in the declaration above.

**Verified use:** [`mdtests/stdlib_every_symbol.md`](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/mdtests/stdlib_every_symbol.md) exercises this symbol and is checked by the ordinary mdtest gate.

### `cstr_readable`

```click
predicate cstr_readable(bytes: uint8[]) {
    exists (len: int32) {
        0 <= len and
            viewable(bytes[0..len + 1]) and
            forall (k: int32) {
                0 <= k and k < len implies bytes[k] != '\0'
            } and
            bytes[len] == '\0' and
        forall (k: int32) { 0 <= k and k < len + 1 implies defined(bytes[k]) }
    }
}
```

**Meaning:** States that the byte array has some dynamically viewable,
null-terminated C-string prefix. The length remains existential; unfold the
predicate when a proof needs to expose that witness.

**Kind:** predicate. Parameter types, requirements, and guarantees are normative in the declaration above.

### `cstr_bounded`

```click
predicate cstr_bounded(bytes: uint8[], max: int32) {
    bytes_contains(bytes, 0, max, '\0')
}
```

**Meaning:** States that a null terminator occurs before the exclusive bound `max`.

**Kind:** predicate. Parameter types, requirements, and guarantees are normative in the declaration above.

**Verified use:** [`mdtests/stdlib_every_symbol.md`](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/mdtests/stdlib_every_symbol.md) exercises this symbol and is checked by the ordinary mdtest gate. Use `unfold(cstr_bounded)` when a proof needs the predicate body.

### `cstr_len_is_viewable`

```click
theorem cstr_len_is_viewable(bytes: uint8[], len: int32) {
    requires cstr_len(bytes, len);

    ensures viewable(bytes[0..len + 1]) by {
        unfold(cstr_len);
        simp();
    }
}
```

**Meaning:** Given an exact C-string length, exposes the viewability of the
prefix and its terminator as a separate fact for a subsequent proof step.

**Kind:** theorem. Parameter types, requirements, and guarantees are normative in the declaration above.

**Verified use:** [`mdtests/cstr_viewable_witness.md`](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/mdtests/cstr_viewable_witness.md) checks this witness projection.

        simp();
    }
}
```

**Meaning:** Given its listed requirements, proves `0 <= len`.

**Kind:** theorem. Parameter types, requirements, and guarantees are normative in the declaration above.

**Verified use:** [`mdtests/stdlib_every_symbol.md`](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/mdtests/stdlib_every_symbol.md) exercises this symbol and is checked by the ordinary mdtest gate.

    ensures cstr_prefix(bytes, len) by {
        unfold(cstr_len);

## External C contracts

These declarations cover the narrow byte-oriented libc slice supported by C0.
They are body-less assumptions: callers must satisfy their requirements, and
Click does not verify an implementation of the external function.

### `__click_constant_p_unknown`

```click
extern int32 __click_constant_p_unknown() {
    ensures result == 0 or result == 1;
}
```

**Meaning:** The value of the GNU builtin `__builtin_constant_p`, which the C
frontend lowers to a call of this function. Whether the compiler folds the
builtin's operand to a constant depends on optimization, so nothing is known
about the result beyond its being 0 or 1, and a proof covers both.

**Kind:** external C contract. The declaration is an explicit verification assumption.

**Verified use:** [`mdtests/c_builtin_constant_p.md`](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/mdtests/c_builtin_constant_p.md) checks that a claim must hold for both values.

### `memcpy`

```click
extern uint8* memcpy(uint8 destination[], uint8 source[], int32 bytes) {
    requires 0 <= bytes;
    requires viewable(source[0..bytes]);
    owns destination[0..bytes];
    requires separate(memory(destination[0..bytes]), memory(source[0..bytes]));
    ensures result == destination;
    ensures bytes_equal(destination, 0, old(source), 0, bytes);
}
```

**Meaning:** Copies `bytes` bytes from a readable, non-overlapping source to
an owned destination and returns the destination pointer. This exact
standard-library declaration also carries the checked representation-copy
effect: after the call, each initialized typed cell whose complete byte
representation lies in the copied range is established at the mapped
destination offset. A source cell the copy would split, a symbolic range, an
unaligned destination, and an untyped source establish no typed value. The
effect is bound to this declaration, not to the name `memcpy`.

**Kind:** external C contract. The declaration is an explicit verification assumption.

**Verified use:** [`mdtests/stdlib_external_contracts.md`](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/mdtests/stdlib_external_contracts.md) checks its postcondition.

### `memcmp`

```click
extern int32 memcmp(uint8 left[], uint8 right[], int32 bytes) {
    requires 0 <= bytes;
    requires viewable(left[0..bytes]);
    requires viewable(right[0..bytes]);
    requires forall (k: int32) { 0 <= k and k < bytes implies defined(left[k]) and defined(right[k]) };
    ensures result == 0 implies bytes_equal(left, 0, right, 0, bytes);
    ensures result != 0 implies not bytes_equal(left, 0, right, 0, bytes);
}
```

**Meaning:** Reads both byte ranges without mutation and distinguishes equal
from unequal prefixes by whether the result is zero.

**Kind:** external C contract. The declaration is an explicit verification assumption.

**Verified use:** [`mdtests/stdlib_external_contracts.md`](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/mdtests/stdlib_external_contracts.md) checks its equality consequence.

### `memset`

```click
extern uint8* memset(uint8 destination[], int32 value, int32 bytes) {
    requires 0 <= value;
    requires value <= 255;
    requires 0 <= bytes;
    owns destination[0..bytes];
    ensures result == destination;
    ensures (0..bytes).all(|k| {
        defined(destination[k]) and destination[k] == value
    });
}
```

**Meaning:** Fills an owned destination with the low byte of a representable
value and returns the destination pointer.

**Kind:** external C contract. The declaration is an explicit verification assumption.

**Verified use:** [`mdtests/stdlib_external_contracts.md`](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/mdtests/stdlib_external_contracts.md) checks its byte-fill consequence.

### `strlen`

```click
extern int32 strlen(uint8 bytes[]) {
    requires cstr_readable(bytes);
    ensures 0 <= result;
    ensures viewable(bytes[0..result + 1]);
    ensures forall (k: int32) {
        0 <= k and k < result implies bytes[k] != '\0'
    };
    ensures bytes[result] == '\0';
    ensures cstr_readable_len(bytes, result);
    ensures old(bytes[0]) == '\0' implies result == 0;
}
```

**Meaning:** Returns a length for a dynamically viewable, null-terminated byte
string without mutation. The result satisfies the readable-length relation and
points at its null terminator; `cstr_readable_len_unique` can connect it to an
independently framed witness. The separate `old(bytes[0])` consequence retains
the concrete empty-string guarantee.

**Kind:** external C contract. The declaration is an explicit verification assumption.

**Verified use:** [`mdtests/stdlib_external_contracts.md`](https://github.com/clicklang/click/blob/master/mdtests/stdlib_external_contracts.md) checks its length consequence.

## Namespace and extension rules

Standard-library definitions share the logic-declaration namespace with user
Click definitions. A user predicate, pure function, resource, or theorem can't
redefine a prelude name. A C function contract can have the same name as a
prelude pure function when no user Click definition creates a conflict.

To add a public symbol:

1. Add its declaration to `stdlib/prelude.click`.
2. Add a focused mdtest that uses it from an ordinary sidecar.
3. Add its semantic entry here; the inventory and exact-declaration checks fail
   until this page agrees with the source.
4. Add general prover or kernel support only when the definition exposes a
   reusable reasoning gap. Don't hard-code a domain-specific library name into
   the kernel merely because it is useful.

Connects a defined signed machine remainder to mathematical truncation. Native definedness excludes both a zero divisor and `INT32_MIN % -1`; a nonzero mathematical divisor alone does not establish that the C operation is defined.
