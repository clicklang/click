# Tracing a failed proof

This page is the procedure for repairing a failed proof from its diagnostic
and `--trace-proof` output: find the goal that could not be proved, prove it
through explicit intermediate goals, and stop at one of seven named outcomes. It
replaces trial-and-error tactic variation with a decomposition that each
attempt must advance.

[Proof-failure triage](proof-failure-triage.md) classifies a failure once it
is understood. This page is how you come to understand it.

## Every proof error has a goal

Click reports four kinds of error. Only a proof error enters this procedure.

| Error kind | What it means | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `syntax error` | The sidecar does not parse. | Fix the source at the reported line. |
| `type error` | The sidecar parses but does not elaborate. | Fix the named declaration. |
| `internal error` | The verifier failed. | The outcome is [`unclear-trace`](#outcomes). |
| `proof error` | A checked operation could not establish something. | Follow the procedure below. |

A proof error names its **goal**: the proposition that had to be true at a
program point and was not proved there. A goal can come from an `ensures`
clause, a written `have`, a call's precondition, a definedness requirement such
as the absence of signed overflow, or a memory access. The report prints it on
a `goal:` line. Whatever its source, a goal is proved the same way: by the implicit tail when
the proof is omitted or the script leaves the goal open, by the implicit closer
(reported as `implicit closer`) when a `step()` or `fold` leaves a requirement
open, or by explicit tactics you write.

A goal is read in the state where it is required. A requirement of a C
statement is a goal at that statement's pre-state, so an explicit proof can
prove it just before the statement, with a `have` or a step's `requires`
entry.

## Crashes and hangs

Two failures are defects in Click whatever the proof says, and end the
procedure as soon as they happen:

| Failure | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `crash` | Click exits without a report: a panic, an abort, a stack overflow, or the process being killed. |
| `hang` | Click runs for a long time without returning. Click bounds its own work and stops with a limit error, so a run that does not finish in minutes, with no report, is a hang. |

Do not change the proof, raise a limit, or retry to get past either one.
[Report it](#reporting-a-bug) with the exact command, the `click --version`
output, the complete output (for a hang, how long it ran before you stopped
it), and the files needed to rerun it. Shrinking them helps, but the report
need not wait for it.

## Getting a trace

Read the ordinary report first. It gives the goal, the branch facts, and the
failing tactic. When the goal alone does not explain the failure, rerun the
command the report prints under `To get a trace:`:

```text
click verify --trace-proof PROOF SIDECAR
click verify --trace-proof PROOF --trace-to LINE SIDECAR
```

`PROOF` is the function, theorem, or tactic name, and `SIDECAR` is the
`.click` file. `--trace-to LINE` stops at the written tactic on that line, even
in a proof that succeeds; use it to see the facts available at a point where
you intend to write a `have`.

The trace lists each checked step on the failing path and the facts it added
(`adds:`), then a `failed check` section with the goal, the resources held,
and the available premises. Those premises are what an explicit proof of the
goal can use. [Reading trace output](#reading-trace-output) describes the
notation.

A goal about memory, such as a `transport` target or any goal that reads
`read<...>(snapshot#N, pointer=value#M)`, depends on what its labels denote.
Record the legend line defining each label the goal uses: two spellings of one
C address, such as a pointer local and the `g + 16 bytes` cell it was loaded
from, or a read at entry and the same read inside a loop, are often the whole
explanation.

## Identify the primitive rule

Before splitting a link, identify the inference that should justify it. A
single proof step has specified premises, a specified conclusion, and a
checked rule connecting them. Counting tactic calls is insufficient: one
`transport ... using` can still hide a history walk. Conversely, an explicit
certificate may contain several primitive steps.

Use this map to find the applicable rule, then read its full **Accepts** list
and checked examples. The linked tactic reference is the catalog of supported
forms; this map groups them by the argument they express, not by a promise
that every current implementation meets the checking-cost contract.

| Argument needed | Rule reference | Explicit input to identify |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reuse a fact or select a conjunct | [Available facts](../reference/tactics/index.md#available-facts), [extracting a fact](../reference/tactics/index.md#extracting-a-fact) | The available proposition and selected component |
| Introduce an assumption or binder, split cases, or instantiate a universal fact | [Introducing a binder or premise](../reference/tactics/index.md#introducing-a-binder-or-premise), [explicit cases](../reference/tactics/index.md#explicit-cases), [instantiation with selected premises](../reference/tactics/index.md#instantiation-with-selected-premises) | The connective or quantified fact, witnesses, and branch obligations |
| Replace an equal term | [Rewriting](../reference/tactics/index.md#rewriting) | The equality, direction, and expression being rewritten |
| Evaluate a definition or computation | [Unfolding pure functions](../reference/tactics/index.md#unfolding-pure-functions), [context-free normalization](../reference/tactics/index.md#context-free-normalization) | The named definition/application or explicit expression |
| Apply a mathematical or separation law | [Theorem application with selected premises](../reference/tactics/index.md#theorem-application-with-selected-premises), [library laws](../reference/library/index.md) | The named theorem, typed arguments, and each instantiated requirement |
| Establish arithmetic | [Arithmetic certificates](../reference/tactics/index.md#arithmetic-certificates) | The family, cited premises, and checked certificate nodes |
| Execute one program statement | [Single statements](../reference/tactics/index.md#single-statements), [one statement obligation](../reference/tactics/index.md#one-statement-obligation) | The statement, its preconditions, and resulting state/effect |
| Preserve a fact across a state transition | [Transport certificates](../reference/tactics/index.md#transport-certificates), [Transport with selected premises](../reference/tactics/index.md#transport-with-selected-premises) | The source fact, before/after states, checked effect, and separation or other frame premises |
| Manipulate ownership or open a resource definition | [Scoped resource opening](../reference/tactics/index.md#scoped-resource-opening), [tactic reference](../reference/tactics/index.md) | The selected resource instance, its definition, and required ownership quantities |

When adding a primitive, document its premises, conclusion, explicit Click
form, supported types and states, and checking-cost bound in its reference
entry. Include a passing example and controls for invalid premises, and
expansion/replay coverage when search can produce the step. A tactic name
without this rule contract is not enough guidance for tracing.

Do not invent a library law because its mathematical statement seems familiar.
Find the declaration or documented kernel rule, instantiate its premises, and
say which premise is missing. If the premises and conclusion are expressible
and the inference is sound, but no supported primitive expresses it, stop at
`missing-rule`. Give that inference for design discussion instead of repeatedly
changing tactics or demanding intermediate facts with no rule to connect them.
If a documented rule already covers the link and refuses it, use
`failing-tactic` instead. If the mathematics itself is not established, use
`unclear-goal`; a failed search alone is not evidence of a missing rule.

### One-step preservation must be fast

The explicit `transport_certificate` uses `premise`, `preserve`, `transitive`,
and `conclusion`. Cite `separate(region.footprint, B)` as a premise;
`preserve` establishes the after-to-before read equality. The execution-produced
footprint includes writes, call effects and allocation release. Establish its
separation with `normalize() using` and explicitly listed separations and bounds.
For a region containing several transitions, spell the individual preservation
nodes and compose their equalities: simple normalization does not walk a region.
The observation rule covers complete pointer, byte, 32/64-bit integer and abstract
typed cells, plus explicitly selected fields of named owned resources. For a
resource field, separate the footprint from the instance and write the field
equality across the exact entry/exit states; no unfolding or field search is
part of this primitive.
Use the [certificate reference](../reference/tactics/index.md#transport-certificates)
for exact syntax and current producer/observation limits.

The required primitive for one recorded transition has this logical shape:

```text
observe(before, B, selector) = value
checked region before -> after has effect footprint A
separate(A, B)
-----------------------------------------------------
observe(after, B, selector) = value
```

Here B supports the complete selected observation (a typed memory cell or a
named resource field), and the source observation is valid. The effect
must include invalidation and allocation lifetime changes, as well as ordinary
writes. The transition/effect comes from checked execution;
separation comes from an explicit proof. Neither is an assumption the user may
invent. Its cost must be proportional to the selected read, supplied premises,
and explicit transition effect, up to indexing factors, independent of the
history before `before`. A large explicit effect may require proportional work.

“One step” here means one checked program transition, not one internal memory
construction. Caching a read, forgetting cached cells, or retaining an older
read origin must not make the author prove a chain of bookkeeping equalities
or make the checker search that chain. The value supplied from the preceding
step and the separation premise must suffice for this primitive.

This is a checking design requirement, not a claim that current `transport`
already implements it for every read kind. Separate a failure to express the
rule, a refusal of a documented rule, and a successful check that still walks
history. For the last case, retain a deterministic scaling reproduction as
required by [verifier design](../internals/verifier-design.md); proof success
alone does not meet the cost requirement.

Test the one-step bound by growing the preceding history while holding the
last store, read, and supplied premises fixed. Check pointer-valued as well as
scalar reads, and reject a store that overlaps the read. This measures the
primitive rather than merely demonstrating a short successful proof.

For a multi-step transport, discovering the intermediate transitions or
premises may be search. Its expansion must name the transitions and premises
used by the primitive applications, so replay costs roughly the written proof
size and does not rediscover history. An explicit `using` list only selects
premises; it does not by itself certify that checking is fast.

## The procedure

1. **Record the goal.** Write down the failing goal `G`, the program point
   where it is required, and the premises available there. If the report has
   no `goal:` line, or you cannot read it, stop at `unclear-trace`.
2. **Decide whether `G` is true.** Check it against the contract, the branch
   facts, and the C semantics. If it is false on some execution the contract
   admits, stop at `false-goal`.
3. **Write the argument.** State why `G` follows from the premises as a chain
   of intermediate facts: the premises imply `A`, `A` implies `B`, and `B`
   implies `G`. Write each link as a `have` at the program point, so the proof
   checks it. If you cannot state the argument, stop at `unclear-goal`. If you
   cannot write one of the intermediate facts in Click, stop at
   `inexpressible-fact`.
4. **Run it.** The first link that fails is the new `G`. Return to step 1 with
   it.
5. **Refine a link that does not close.** Identify its primitive rule using
   the map above. If the argument needs several rules, split it into links
   with those rules as endpoints and run again. A failed smart tactic does
   not establish whether a link is primitive. Stop splitting when all the
   premises for a documented primitive are written, or when a concrete sound
   inference has no supported primitive (`missing-rule`). Do not classify a
   link as primitive solely because it is one tactic call.
   The [tactic table](../reference/tactics/index.md) gives each tactic's class,
   and `click docs NAME` prints its forms and documented behavior. A refusal
   may identify the tactic with `refused by:`; `refused by: nothing` means
   that the proof ended with the goal open. If a written primitive is refused
   within its documented **Accepts** list, stop at `failing-tactic`.

   To split a link that a smart tactic proved part of, read its trace: a step
   marked ``(from `implicit tail`)``, ``(from `solve`)`` or
   ``(from `implicit closer`)`` is one that smart work took, and a `chosen:`
   line is the written form of an argument its search chose ([Reading trace
   output](#reading-trace-output)). Writing those out leaves only the
   unproved part of the link.
6. **On a search miss, write the argument.** An elided form, such as
   `apply(t(x))` or a bare `transport(P, Q)`, searches for an argument that
   a simple form of the same tactic takes written. When the search finds
   nothing, the refusal says "this is a search miss" and its `refused by:`
   line says the search found nothing. State the missing fact with `have`
   first, or write the `using` form, and run again. Only the written form's
   refusal can be `failing-tactic`.

Before each run, say in one line which link is new and why it should hold.
Changing a tactic, its spelling, or its position without changing the chain is
not a new attempt. Do not edit `solve` or the implicit closer, raise a budget, or change the C
to get past a link.

Before reporting a refused simple link, shrink the link itself, not only the
program around it. Drop each `using` premise, alias, and earlier `have` it does
not need while the refusal stays; spell it with the C local the statement uses
rather than a spec alias; and find the nearest link that passes, such as the
same transport of another field across the same store, noting what differs
(the field's type and width, its offset, the address spelling). Then compare
the refusal with the one-line argument and name the step Click did not take:
which addresses it did not identify, which read it did not carry, which fact
it did not read.

## Outcomes

The procedure ends at exactly one of these:

| Outcome | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `success` | The proof verifies. Keep the explicit links that the default automation needed; they document the argument. |
| `false-goal` | `G` does not hold on some execution the contract admits. Give the counterexample: the claim, the contract, or the C is wrong, not the proof. |
| `unclear-goal` | You cannot say why `G` holds. Give `G`, the premises, and what you tried. |
| `missing-rule` | The premises and conclusion are expressible and the inference is justified, but no supported primitive connects them. Record the rule schema, the references checked, and the reduced example for design discussion. This is not established by a search miss alone. |
| `inexpressible-fact` | The argument needs an intermediate fact Click cannot write, such as a missing predicate, quantifier form, memory spelling, or resource form. Report a bug. |
| `failing-tactic` | Every link is written, and one link is a single simple tactic that is refused although the link is within what that tactic is documented to do. Report a bug. |
| `unclear-trace` | The failure has no `goal:` line, the goal cannot be read (for example, it is spelled with placeholders such as `<unnamed A>` that no proof can name), or the refusal is not "goal `G` was not proved". Report a bug. |

A smart tactic that does not prove a link is never `failing-tactic`: smart
tactics may miss even a primitive link; identify its rule and supply its premises. A search miss is never
`failing-tactic` either: the argument is still to be written. `false-goal` and
`unclear-goal` usually mean the claim, the contract, or the argument needs
another look rather than that Click is wrong.

### Reporting a bug

The three bug outcomes, a crash, and a hang are defects in Click. Report one
with the user's approval, as an issue at
<https://github.com/clicklang/click/issues> that contains enough to reproduce
it. Label the issue with its outcome (`tracing: inexpressible-fact`,
`tracing: failing-tactic`, `tracing: unclear-trace`, `crash`, or `hang`), and
start its title with it in brackets (`[failing-tactic] ...`, `[hang] ...`) so
it shows even without permission to set labels.

A crash or hang report contains what [Crashes and hangs](#crashes-and-hangs)
lists. A report of one of the three outcomes contains:

- the smallest C and Click that still fail, keeping the original source
  pattern, with the exact command and its output, including the `goal:` line;
- the chain up to the failure, with every earlier link proved;
- the failing link in its smallest form: its goal, the tactic, and the
  refusal, with the legend line for every label the goal uses;
- the nearest passing link and what differs from it;
- why the link holds, in one line of mathematics, and the step of that
  argument Click did not take; and
- for `failing-tactic`, the item of that tactic's **Accepts** list that
  covers the link, or for `unclear-trace`, what in the output is missing or
  misleading.

## Worked example

`frame` returns one more than the product its callee computes:

<!-- verified-example: mdtests/tracing_a_nonlinear_bound_is_the_refused_goal.md -->
```c
int area(int w, int h) { return w * h; }
int frame(int w, int h) {
    int inner = area(w, h);
    return inner + 1;
}
```

<!-- verified-example: mdtests/tracing_a_nonlinear_bound_is_the_refused_goal.md -->
```click
int32 frame(int32 w, int32 h) {
    requires w >= 0 and w <= 1000;
    requires h >= 0 and h <= 1000;
    ensures to_integer(result) == to_integer(w * h + 1);
}
```

With `area`'s contract stating `to_integer(result) == to_integer(w * h)`
under the same bounds, the omitted proof is refused: its implicit tail steps to
the `return`, where the closer of the statement's requirements cannot prove
that the addition does not overflow. It ends with the goal and how to prove it
(abbreviated):

```text
proof error:
  `frame.ensures_0` tactic 0
  `step()` produced undefined behavior
  signed overflow
  ...
  `return inner + 1;`

tactic: step
  ...
goal: inner <= 2147483646
help: to prove the goal explicitly, step to this statement and prove it there with `have <goal> by { ... }`
```

1. **Goal.** `inner <= 2147483646` before `return inner + 1;`. The trace's
   failed check lists the bounds on `w` and `h`, and the call step added
   `inner == w * h`.
2. **True?** Yes: `w * h` is at most `1000 * 1000`.
3. **Argument.** `inner == w * h`, `w * h <= 1000000`, and `1000000 <=
   2147483646`. The middle link is the one the implicit closer did not
   derive, because it is nonlinear.
4. **Write it.** Step through the declaration and the call, then state the
   link:

<!-- verified-example: mdtests/tracing_an_intermediate_goal_proves_the_bound.md -->
```click
    ensures to_integer(result) == to_integer(w * h + 1) by {
        step(); step();
        have to_integer(w * h) <= 1000000 by solve();
    }
```

The implicit tail runs the `return` and closes the claim. The proof verifies:
`success`. Had `have to_integer(w * h) <= 1000000 by solve();` been refused, it would be the new goal, to split further, for example through
`w * h <= 1000 * h`.

## Reading trace output

An explicitly requested `--trace-proof` keeps its typed diagnostic notation:
readable Click expressions are used there only when they preserve the checked
operands, and otherwise a memory operand prints as
`read<Bits64>(snapshot#1, pointer=value#1)`, in an added fact just as in a goal.
The width, snapshot, and address remain visible even when the source wrote only
`parent->__rb_parent_color`.

In the failed-check section, memory ranges whose identical printed footprints
hide different pointer metadata receive shared `[range A]`, `[range B]`
labels. A range-identity legend gives their object identities and known or
opaque bounds. Comparison happens only when rendering this trace, over at most
64 distinct displayed range representations; hitting that cap is reported.
Equal ranges keep one label, and unambiguous footprints gain no annotation.
This describes a representation mismatch, not additional proof evidence.

Within a trace, goals, requirements, and traced facts share names and snapshot
labels. A `transport` refusal that finds no frame evidence prints its own
legend first, and the trace continues its numbering, so a label in the refusal
and in the `failed check` goal means the same value or snapshot. A field of a named pointer prints as that name
plus its byte offset (`g + 16 bytes`). A bounded legend defines
generated addresses and snapshots, including immutable proof names, pointer-read
constructions, pure pointer calls with their typed arguments, byte offsets,
and memory constructions with their inputs. Pure-call arguments retain model
identities and read snapshots; nested pointer arguments have their own legend
definitions. These constructions explain labels and add no proof evidence. An
initial empty memory is an explicit root. Other snapshots describe a recorded
transition or an internal transformation, such as projecting a source memory
for a particular pointer read, substituting a variable, or joining branch
memories. Read projections name their source snapshot and pointer. Seeded cells
name their source and stride; call and loop effects show their write footprints
when those are specified. Recorded marks and program points appear in these
definitions when they match the snapshot.

A memory-history explanation identifies a blocking store, its snapshot, and the
checked read range and write width. Its result is retained at failure time, so
formatting does not repeat the check under a different verification context.
This diagnostic walks recorded memory history
without using the proof context's equality and ownership facts. Failure to show
separation in that walk does not mean the proof has no separating evidence.
Subsequent transitions mentioned by the explanation are memory transitions, not
necessarily C statements.

Construction records travel with snapshots across threads and are excluded from
memory equality and proof evidence. A missing record on a noninitial snapshot is
reported as an internal recording defect, not a normal unknown origin. New memory
constructors must retain their operation and inputs; snapshots changed without
updating their record must not inherit an old explanation. Referenced labels are
expanded within the report budget, with display omissions explicit. Source marks
and program points are used only for matching snapshots, never guessed from nearby
statements. These definitions describe constructions, not additional checked
equalities or a complete execution history.

Each trace addition uses `adds:` followed by the same proposition form used
for `goal:` and requirements. Typed diagnostic notation is used wherever a
source expression would hide checked identities. This includes pointer and scalar equalities,
viewability with byte extents, model/function equalities, resource containment,
validated resource-composition entries, and distinct volatile-write events.
Internal notation is not promised to be valid Click proof input. Read types,
read snapshots, arithmetic widths, and signedness remain visible. Resource
compositions list up to eight entries with ownership quantities or view access;
omitted entries and support details are explicit. A write event records an
access, not an equality about the current memory contents.

Only the new facts at each checked step are printed, not the accumulated set.

A step that a search produced says which one. A step that smart work checked
ends its header with ``(from `implicit tail`)`` or the like, naming its
origin: `implicit tail` for the steps the implicit tail took and for its
closer, `solve` for a written `solve()`, and
`implicit closer` for an obligation a `step()` or `fold` left open. A step whose `using` list a search chose, under a smart tactic or in an
elided form such as `apply(t(x))` or a bare `transport(P, Q)`, has a `chosen:`
line with the step written out in full, as `click expand` writes it:

```text
tactic@11: apply
  chosen: apply(le_trans(x, y, z)) using { x <= y; y <= z; };
  adds: x <= z
```

Writing the `chosen:` form removes the search for those arguments. It does
not establish that the checked implementation avoids history walks; apply
the one-step cost requirement above separately. A step with neither mark is one the script wrote.

A failure trace also ends with a separately labelled `failed check`. It retains
the refusal, checking stage, proof context, up to sixteen available premises,
and up to twelve resources from the retained C state, even when the first operation fails before a checked step can
be recorded. For postcondition failures, current-state names and resources come from the
selected outcome; permissions consumed by a call are not shown as still held.
The failed check is not an accepted execution step. A proposition
proof has a fixed execution state; an execution tactic refused there names that
restriction rather than implying that the tactic is unavailable everywhere.
When an explicit script ends with a goal still open, its failure retains the
checked prefix and the remaining goal and premises after those steps, rather
than the state at script entry. This includes execution `have` bodies and pure
theorem scripts.

Written `solve` failures retain a bounded sample of the read-value queries and
cell walks actually performed during that attempt. Ordinary errors summarize
up to two observations of each kind and eight available premises; traces show
up to sixteen observations of each kind, with shared
snapshot and address labels, access widths, stopping reasons and query modes.
These records include speculative search queries and are not additional proof
facts or a claim that one observed stop explains the entire search failure.
A check with no instrumented memory query says so in its trace. The capture
limit bounds diagnostic storage and does not stop or change verification.
Supplemental memory-history explanations are labelled separately: their walk
does not use the failing check's equality or ownership context. Actual query
observations retain the context's result without rerunning it while printing.

A loop-closure search error names its unresolved obligation from the member
planner or the retained focused goal, including when that search exhausted its work budget.
If no individual obligation was retained, the diagnostic says that the failure
applies to the bundle search. A budget refusal reports an unfinished proof
attempt; it does not establish that the named obligation is false.

A failed pointer-valued resource child argument comparison reports the exact
supplied and required values and the argument position. Up to four explicit
equalities sharing the supplied value may be shown as potentially relevant
evidence. That selection is diagnostic guidance, not a claim about the cause
of failure or a prescription for the missing proof. The comparison uses the
same value and snapshot labels as the preceding trace facts.
These details are diagnostic only and do not add equalities or change proof
checking.
