# Profiling

Click profiling attributes verifier work to source-level proof sites. Use it
after ordinary verification succeeds, or while diagnosing an unexpected
timeout. A profile of a non-verifying target is an incomplete frontier, not a
normal optimization baseline.

The report separates smart-tactic work, simple-tactic checking, and nested
control-tactic work. Thresholds filter categories for readability; they do
not change whether a proof is valid. The total elapsed time also includes work
that can't be charged cleanly to a single displayed site.

A successful slow smart tactic is an expansion candidate because expansion can
remove its planning and search. A slow simple tactic is already direct checked
work and is therefore a verifier performance defect, not another expansion
candidate.

The implicit `auto` that proves a simple tactic's open requirement, such as a
bare `step()`'s obligation or a bare `fold`'s body fact, is reported as its own
smart row named `implicit auto` at that tactic's site and charged to the smart
budget. A bare simple tactic is not a selectable expansion site, so the row's
expansion command expands its claim (`click expand --claim`), which writes the
proof as the tactic's `by`.

Interpret high work counts before comparing small wall-clock differences.
Deterministic work exposes repeatable algorithmic cost, while elapsed time is
affected by machine load and warm caches. For performance-sensitive changes,
use scaling regressions over multiple input sizes rather than treating one
corpus run as evidence of acceptable complexity.

If profiling shows unexpected slowness, preserve the original source and
reduce the verifier behavior. Don't raise a limit, add an arbitrary search cap,
or rewrite working C to make the measurement disappear.
