//! The cells of a store's own block that its constant byte gap keeps, as key
//! ranges a store never has to visit.
//!
//! [`crate::kernel::CMemory::without_possible_aliasing_cells`] decides every
//! earlier cell of the written block, and the cell map offers no way to keep
//! a group of cells without asking each, so `N` stores to cells the facts
//! keep apart used to ask `N^2/2` questions. Most of those cells are not a
//! question at all: a cell at `S + c` beside a store at `S + k` shares the
//! store's symbolic anchor `S`, and the constant gap `c - k` decides whether
//! their bytes meet. That is the rule a run's slots already follow
//! ([`super::memory_resolution::run_slots_kept_by_store`], its `Shift`
//! branch).
//!
//! # What is skipped, and why the answer is the same
//!
//! The ranges this module returns name only cells whose offset is spelled
//! `Constant(c)` beside a store at `Constant(k)`, or `Add(S, Constant(c))`
//! beside a store at `Add(S, Constant(k))` or at bare `S`, for one anchor
//! `S`, with `c != 0` and the two byte windows disjoint for every cell width
//! (`c + 16 <= k` or `k + bytes <= c`; no `CValue` is wider than sixteen
//! bytes, and a `Void` cell stands in sixteen). Because [`PointerOffsetTerm`] orders
//! `Constant` before every other variant, the keys `Add(S, Constant(c))` for
//! `c` in one interval are exactly one contiguous key range, and so are the
//! keys `Constant(c)`.
//!
//! For each such cell the store's per-cell ladder answers "keep", and it
//! reads no fact on the way:
//!
//! * normalization leaves the cell's offset as it is: the anchor's scaled
//!   values are variables, which exact-load normalization never rewrites,
//!   and rebuilding `Add(S, Constant(c))` with `c != 0` over an anchor that
//!   is neither a constant nor ends in one is the same term (checked once
//!   per store on the anchor, [`anchor_is_normal`]);
//! * `StoreByteInterval::overwrites` compares the same atoms at shifts that
//!   differ by `c - k`, and the windows are disjoint;
//! * `access_byte_overlap` finds the constant shift `c - k` —
//!   `pointer_byte_offset_from_base` cancels the shared `S` through the
//!   bitvector `subtract` rule for two sums with one base (checked once per
//!   store on the anchor's byte form, [`anchor_byte_form_cancels`]), or reads
//!   `c` directly against a bare-`S` store — and answers `Separate`;
//! * `pointers_proven_distinct_for_memory_resolution` proves distinctness by
//!   its offset-cancellation rung, which matches the shared `S` by
//!   structural identity before it would consult a fact, and then compares
//!   two different constants; for two constant offsets, the offset
//!   disequality rung decides `Constant(c) == Constant(k)` false.
//!
//! The rungs before those (ownership, the range rungs after them) can only
//! keep a cell too. So skipping these cells changes neither the result nor
//! the forget mark: a kept cell never sets it. Two things the ladder does
//! besides answering are not reproduced, and each disables the skip:
//! while implicit reasoning provenance is being captured, the ownership
//! rung records the composition it used, so nothing is skipped; and once the
//! verification deadline has passed, the ladder refuses every question, so
//! nothing is skipped either. A deadline that passes during one store's scan
//! can still leave that store keeping cells the ladder would have dropped
//! for want of time; keeping them is what the byte arithmetic proves, and
//! the verification has failed on its deadline anyway.
//!
//! Every other cell of the block goes down the unchanged ladder. Debug
//! builds re-ask the ladder about the skipped cells (a bounded sample per
//! store) and fail if it would drop one.
