//! A snapshot's cell map: concrete cells plus symbolic runs of seeded cells.
//!
//! A contract that holds a constant range, `views a[0..N]`, makes every
//! element of it a known cell at entry: the cell at `a + i` holds the load of
//! `a + i` in the memory the range was seeded over. Storing those `N` cells
//! one by one made the size of a proof depend on the numeric length of the
//! range, so a [`CellRun`] records the whole range once instead. Every
//! consumer still sees exactly the cells seeding would have stored:
//! [`CellStore::logical`] is that cell map, and each mutation keeps the run
//! and the concrete map in one canonical form.
//!
//! A function's entry names every element of a symbolic static-storage array
//! (a global or `static` array whose contents the function does not know) the
//! same way, one element at a time, so a `static char buf[65536]` cost 65,536
//! cells at every entry. Such an array is a run too. Its slots spell their
//! loads as the entry does ([`RunValueMode::SymbolicStorage`]): an element of
//! pointer type is a fresh symbolic pointer, which may point into any block,
//! rather than a pointer into the run's own block. The mode is part of the
//! run's identity.
//!
//! Static storage whose contents the function does know (program startup,
//! or a `const` array) used to be stored element by element too, so
//! `int32 buf[1000000];` cost a million stores before `main` began. The
//! elements its initializer leaves at one value are a run whose every slot
//! holds that value ([`RunValueMode::Constant`]), with the written elements
//! stored over it.
//!
//! **Canonical form.** For each run, a slot is either *live* — it holds the
//! run's value and the concrete map has no entry at its pointer — or a
//! *hole*, whose pointer the concrete map may or may not hold, and never with
//! the run's own value. A store of the run's value into a hole refills the
//! slot rather than caching a concrete copy, and holes are kept as disjoint,
//! non-adjacent intervals. A pointer is a live slot of at most one run. A run
//! with no live slot holds no cell and is retired: the store never keeps one,
//! so it neither costs a later scan nor makes two stores with the same cells
//! differ in representation. Runs are never split.
//!
//! **Index.** The runs are one persistent ordered map keyed by [`RunKey`]:
//! the run's block, then where its slots are anchored in the block (a
//! constant base offset, or one symbolic offset every slot shifts from), then
//! the rest of what [`CellRun::same_slots_as`] compares. So the runs of one
//! block are one key range ([`AliasCandidates`] walks runs exactly as it
//! walks cells), the runs a pointer can be a slot of are found without
//! visiting the others, two stores' runs pair up by key, and two stores that
//! share their runs' persistent nodes are compared, hashed and diffed in the
//! work of what they do not share. The key orders the run's source memory by
//! its content hash before its structure, so no key comparison walks a
//! memory unless two sources' hashes collide. A slot is spelled as a load of
//! its address is ([`CellRun::slot_pointer`]): its run's base plus a constant,
//! folded into any constant the base ends in, so every slot lies on its
//! base's *line*, the base's block and the stem the base adds a constant to
//! (`CoverLine`). Every run is also filed by the bytes its slots span on its
//! line, in `CellStore::span_cover`, so a pointer finds exactly the runs
//! whose span on its line holds it. Equality, hashing and ordering read only the
//! concrete map and the run map, never that cover or the cached counts,
//! which are functions of the run map, so a store's identity does not
//! depend on the order its runs were added in.
