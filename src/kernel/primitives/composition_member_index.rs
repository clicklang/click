//! Candidate lookup over a context's stated resource compositions.
//!
//! A path states a composition at every call, fold, unfold and store, and
//! keeps each one: `resource_compositions` grows with the path. Separation
//! by ownership asks for a composition holding two given objects as distinct
//! owned members, and scanning every stated composition for one made each
//! such question linear in the path (`roadmap/scaling.md`). This index names
//! the compositions that can answer instead.
//!
//! **Keys.** A composition is listed under the base, the block and the
//! anchor offset of owned memory members, which are exactly the keys a
//! member lookup probes (`ResourceContext::owned_memory_members_with_base`,
//! the block buckets, `owned_memory_by_anchor`), and under the
//! `OwnedMemberKey` of owned members of other resources, the bucket a
//! direct match reads (`direct_match_candidate_positions`).
//!
//! **Incremental admission.** A snapshot is listed only under the owned
//! members it holds beyond some earlier admitted snapshot, its predecessor:
//! the last one of its own storage origin, read from the storage history, or
//! else the last admitted one or the root when its member index shares
//! enough persistent structure with them that the difference is smaller
//! than the snapshot. Successive snapshots of one resource context, a call's
//! partition beside the frame it was taken from, differ by a few facts, so
//! admission costs what changed, not what the snapshot holds. A snapshot with
//! no such predecessor is listed under all of its owned members. The one exception is the first composition
//! admitted, commonly the function's whole entry frame: it is not listed at
//! all but kept as the `root`, a candidate for every question, whose own
//! member indexes answer it. Holding one composition is then constant work,
//! as `ObjectEvidenceSources` holds its first source.
//!
//! **Completeness for pairs.** Let two members both be held by an admitted
//! snapshot `S`. If `S` has no predecessor, it is listed under both members'
//! keys or is the root, which every question reads. If its predecessor lacks
//! one of the two, `S` is listed under that member's keys. Otherwise the
//! predecessor, admitted earlier, holds both, and the argument repeats on it. A question about a pair
//! that reads the candidates under both members' keys therefore reaches a
//! snapshot holding both whenever any stated composition does. The answer it
//! derives from that snapshot is the one `S` would give: owned members of a
//! valid composition are disjoint, so each object finds the same member.
