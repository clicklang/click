//! A canonical persistent multiset of resource facts.
//!
//! Two resource contexts holding the same facts were told apart, or found
//! equal, by walking both fact lists: a context rebuilt with the facts it
//! started from (a call takes the caller's ownership and hands it back) is
//! equal to the one it was rebuilt from, and every fact set that met both
//! paid a walk of the whole context (`issues/scaling.md`). This set's shape
//! is a function of its contents alone, and its nodes are interned, so two
//! sets with the same facts share one root and compare by pointer.
//!
//! **Shape.** A treap ordered by fact, each node's priority the fact's
//! content hash, ties broken by fact order: for a given multiset there is
//! exactly one such tree, whatever order its facts were inserted and
//! removed in. Insertion and removal split and merge along one path,
//! expected O(log n).
//!
//! **Interning.** Every node is made through a thread-local table keyed by
//! its fact's hash, its count and its children's addresses, holding weak
//! references. A node whose fact, count and children equal a live node's is
//! that node. By induction from the leaves, two live trees of one table with
//! equal contents are the same tree. A weak reference keeps its node's
//! allocation, so no address in the table can be reused while it stands;
//! entries are only ever dropped once their node is gone.
//!
//! **Domains.** A tree built on one thread may be extended on another, whose
//! table did not make its older nodes. Each node records the table that made
//! it and whether its whole subtree came from that table. Two pure trees of
//! one table are equal exactly when their roots are one node; any other pair
//! is compared fact by fact.
