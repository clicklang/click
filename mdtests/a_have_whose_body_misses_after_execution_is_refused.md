# A `have` whose body misses after execution is refused

The companion of
`a_have_whose_body_misses_between_execution_steps_is_refused.md`: the same
written `have` after `execute()` is refused with the same reason, the failing
step of its script.

```c filename=a_have_whose_body_misses_after_execution_is_refused.c
void mark_one(int32 a[], int32 n, int32 i, int32 m) {
    a[i] = 1;
}
```

    requires 0 <= i;
    requires i < n;
    requires 0 <= m;
