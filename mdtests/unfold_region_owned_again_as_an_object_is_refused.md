# Contradictory region ownership is still refused by raw contract validation

The contract owns `*s` both inside `pool_slot(s)` and beside it. Instance
unfold now exposes the already-held body without searching the frame for
overlap. The later raw contract-ownership validation still rejects the duplicated
flat descriptor. Keep this refusal distinct from the framed unfold rule; the
positive control is `unfold_region_then_write_a_descriptor_of_its_type.md`.

```c filename=unfold_region_owned_again_as_an_object_is_refused.c
struct pool {
    int32* data;
    int32 n;
};

struct slot {
    struct pool* pool;
    int32 at;
    int32 end;
};

int32 peek(struct slot* s) {
    struct pool* pool;

    pool = s->pool;
    return pool->n;
}
```

```click
resource pool_state(pool: struct pool*) {
    field live: int32;
    owns pool->data;
    owns pool->n;
    fact 0 <= live;
}

resource pool_slot(s: struct slot*) {
    field at: int32;
    field end: int32;
    owns *s;
    owns s->pool->data[at..end];
    fact s->at == at;
    fact s->end == end;
    fact 0 <= at;
    fact at < end;
}
