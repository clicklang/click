# A locked helper spends its member under the acquired authority

`release` locks the object's mutex, opens the acquired control, spends the
member its caller lends, decrements the counter, and restores the control
before unlocking. The acquisition enters the population with a fresh total
bounded below by the lent member, so the helper's count facts relate only to
that acquisition. Its contract declares the death with `consumes`, and the
helper's checked spend matches it. The creator applies that death to the
population held by the mutex and, after destruction, observes zero and
retires the authority.

#include <pthread.h>
struct object { pthread_mutex_t mu; int refs; };
void release(struct object *obj) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&obj->mu);
    obj->refs = obj->refs - 1;
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&obj->mu);
}
int run(void) {
    struct object *obj = malloc(sizeof(struct object));
    if (obj == 0) return -1;
    obj->refs = 1;
    pthread_mutex_init(&obj->mu, 0);
    release(obj);
    pthread_mutex_destroy(&obj->mu);
    free(obj);
    return 0;
}
