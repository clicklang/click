# Control: resource-published pointer loads at the same address

Unfolding owns one pointer cell and proves its parameter equal to the model
identity. No C read, write, recursive resource, or snapshot transport is involved.
This control compares two reads through the original parameter.

```c filename=resource_pointer_load_alias.c
struct node { struct node *next; };
void check(struct node *p) {}
```

            fact p == id;
