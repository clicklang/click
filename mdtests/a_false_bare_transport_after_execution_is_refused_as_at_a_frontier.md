# A false bare `transport` after execution is refused as at a frontier

A bare `transport(source, target)` after `execute()` is planned exactly as it
is between execution steps: its source alone is tried as the premise, then the
premise planner selects frame evidence. When nothing carries a false target,
the refusal is the source-only one, which names the store to `a[i]` between
the two states, the same refusal
`a_false_transport_in_a_branch_arm_is_refused_as_on_the_main_line.md` expects
before execution.

```c filename=a_false_bare_transport_after_execution_is_refused_as_at_a_frontier.c
void mark_one(int32 a[], int32 n, int32 i, int32 m) {
    a[i] = 1;
}
