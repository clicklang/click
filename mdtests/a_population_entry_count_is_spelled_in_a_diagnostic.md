# A population entry count is spelled in a diagnostic

A population's count at function entry is an opaque kernel symbol. A
diagnostic spells it as the count it is, `old(count(pool_slot(pool)))` or
`old(count(pool_object(pool, _)))`, rather than as an unnamed value. The
closing ledger fact below is off by one, so the proof fails and lists the
consumed-member bound on the entry slot count among its premises.

```c filename=a_population_entry_count_is_spelled_in_a_diagnostic.c
struct pool {
    int checked_out;
    int capacity;
};

struct object {
    int value;
};

void pool_checkout(struct pool *pool, struct object *object) {
    pool->checked_out = pool->checked_out + 1;
}
```
