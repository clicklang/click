# A read back across a store that misses its cell is the earlier store

`buf[0] = 3; buf[u] = 7; r = buf[0];` reads `7` when `u == 0` and the `3`
otherwise, whichever object `buf` is. The twins below are the same program
over a file-scope array and over a `malloc` buffer, each proved twice: by
`execute()`, and with the case split written as a proof `if` after the store
has run, so the case `u != 0` is learned only after `buf[u] = 7` dropped the
cached `buf[0]`.

In that case the load reads the cell from the recorded history under the
path's facts: `u != 0` places the store off `buf[0]`, and the cell's value
before it is the `3`. Before, only the file-scope twin verified, and only
because its reduced memory happened to equal the snapshot before the store;
the heap store also records the bytes it initialized, so the heap twin's
`have r == 3` was refused. A `calloc` buffer reads the same `3`, not the zero
it was allocated with: the store `buf[0] = 3` replaced that zero, and the
history says so.
