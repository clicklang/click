# A frame over a 64-bit indexed write must exclude its cell

A function stores `v` at a 64-bit index into a region whose length is a
64-bit member of an embedded struct. The frame clause omits `k != i`, so it
claims the written element is unchanged as well, which is false when `v`
differs from the old value. The transport must be refused; this catches a
64-bit quantified frame or a wide-range membership check that lets the
written cell through.

```c filename=a_frame_over_a_64_bit_indexed_write_must_exclude_its_cell.c
struct E { unsigned long n; };
struct S { struct E e; };
void set_at(int *p, const struct S *s, unsigned long i, int v) { p[i] = v; }
```
