# `solve` after execution acts on the first open claim

After execution `solve()` closes the first open goal, as the other closers do;
the implicit closer is the catch-all that closes every goal still open. Here `solve()`
closes `result == 1` and leaves `result == n` for `normalize()`. When `solve`
closed every claim it could, `normalize()` was refused for having no goal.

    return n;

} by {
