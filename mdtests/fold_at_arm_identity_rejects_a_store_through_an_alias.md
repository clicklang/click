# A refold at the arm identity sees a store through an aliasing pointer

The store goes through `q`, and the contract states `q == p`, so it writes
the node's own `right` field under another spelling. Reading `id->right`
through the graph-aligned run slot returns the stored null pointer, never the
value the unfold seeded, and the refold with the old right child is refused.

```c filename=fold_at_arm_identity_rejects_a_store_through_an_alias.c
struct node { struct node *left; struct node *right; int tag; };
void roundtrip(struct node *p, struct node *q) { q->right = 0; }
```
