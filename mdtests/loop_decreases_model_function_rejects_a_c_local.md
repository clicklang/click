# a loop measure over a model may not also read a C local

A measure that reads a binder's model is ranked by the models alone: its two
readings are the head binders' models and the rebound ones. `chain_len(c.model)
+ to_integer(n)` also reads the C local `n`, which moves independently of the
binder, so the measure is refused before any back edge, naming the local.

```c filename=loop_decreases_model_function_rejects_a_c_local.c
void countdown(int32 n) {
    while (n > 0) {
        n = n - 1;
    }
}
```
