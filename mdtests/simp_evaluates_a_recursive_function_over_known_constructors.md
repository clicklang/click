# simp evaluates a recursive function over known constructors

`simp` unfolds a recursive specification function applied to a known
constructor, then keeps unfolding the recursive calls the definition exposes,
to a fixed fuel (design-review P5, R3). An argument known only through an
equation such as `u == Tree::Node(..)` is rewritten to its constructor first.
Each unfold and rewrite is an ordinary checked step in the expansion.

spec enum Tree {
    Leaf,
    Node(int32, Tree, Tree),
}

function count(t: Tree) -> int32 decreases t {
    match t {
        Tree::Leaf => 0,
        Tree::Node(v, l, r) => 1 + count(l),
    }
}

theorem nested_constructors(v: int32, w: int32, r: Tree, s: Tree) {
    ensures count(Tree::Node(v, Tree::Node(w, Tree::Leaf, s), r)) == 2 by simp();
}

theorem constructors_through_equations(t: Tree, u: Tree, v: int32, w: int32, r: Tree, s: Tree) {
    requires u == Tree::Node(w, Tree::Leaf, s);
    requires t == Tree::Node(v, u, r);
    ensures count(t) == 2 by simp();
}

theorem an_unknown_tail_stays_folded(t: Tree, v: int32, l: Tree, r: Tree) {
    requires t == Tree::Node(v, l, r);
    requires count(l) == 3;
    ensures count(t) == 4 by simp();
}
