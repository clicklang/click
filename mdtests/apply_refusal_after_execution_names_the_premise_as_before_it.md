# An `apply` refused after execution names its premise as before it

The companion of `apply_refusal_names_the_premise_a_removed_have_supplied.md`,
with the same `have` and `apply` written after `execute()`. The function
returns `n` so that execution needs no premise of its own. The refusal is the
same: it names the `apply`, the requirement as the lemma writes it, what its
parameter was bound to, and the fact it instantiates to.

fail: `apply(head_nonnegative(a, n))` was refused: `first.contract` proof step tactic 2: required exact fact for theorem `head_nonnegative` is unavailable: requirement 1 `0 < n` with n = n instantiates to `0 < n`
