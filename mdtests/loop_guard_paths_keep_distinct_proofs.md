# Loop guard paths may retain different proofs

The two entries to `a || b` prove `not a implies b` differently: the
`a` path refutes the premise, while the other path uses `b`. Both proofs
are valid and must remain associated with their guard-entry paths.
The loop is deliberately declared divergent so this tests certificate
merging without arithmetic or termination search.

```c filename=loop_guard_paths_keep_distinct_proofs.c
void guard_paths(bool a, bool b) {
    while (a || b) {}
}
```
