# An unwritten arithmetic goal still needs its premise

The companion of `an_arithmetic_certificate_spells_a_goal_an_unfold_left_unwritten.md`
without the `using` premise relating `chain_size(Chain::Link(at, v, rest))` to
`chain_size(rest)`. The goal does not hold on its own, so `arithmetic` refuses
it.

```c filename=unwritten_goal_unlisted.c
void f(int32 *q) {
    return;
}

        Chain::Leaf => 0,
        Chain::Link(at, v, rest) => 1 + chain_size(rest),
    }

function wrap(at: int32*, v: int32, c: Chain) -> Chain {
    Chain::Link(at, v, c)

        Chain::Leaf => { execute(); },
        Chain::Link(at, v, rest) => {
            have chain_size(Chain::Link(at, v, rest)) == 1 + chain_size(rest) by {
                unfold(chain_size(Chain::Link(at, v, rest)));
                normalize();
            }
            have weight(wrap(at, v, rest)) == chain_size(rest) + 2 by {
                unfold(wrap(at, v, rest));
                unfold(weight(Chain::Link(at, v, rest)));
                arithmetic();
            }
            execute();
        },
    }
}
```

```expect
fail: `arithmetic` read the current goal as an Integer linear claim, which does not hold on its own
```
