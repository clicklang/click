# A quantified viewable invariant is initialized by narrowing the held range

The loop states that every prefix of the viewed range is viewable:
`forall (k: int32) { 0 <= k and k <= n implies viewable(a[0..k]) }`. Its
`initialize` proof is the same one a function body writes for the same fact:
introduce `k` and its antecedent, extract the two bounds, and let `solve()`
narrow the held `views a[0..n]`.

The local `steps` is declared before the loop, so the loop-entry memory is a
later snapshot than function entry. The function body relates the two when it
spells the contract's range for a narrowing step; the `initialize` phase is a
fixed-state proof at the loop entry, and its planner used to see no fixed-state
view there at all. `solve()` then had no spelling for the entry-state range and
refused to narrow it, although an explicit `transport` of the same fact checked.
A fixed-state proof now offers its own state to that planner.

The back edge owes the invariant's extent bound for every `k`, the `uint32`
order `k <=u 1073741823`. `close_invariants()` closes that member the way it closes
an unquantified one: it introduces `k` and the antecedent `0 <= k and k <= n`,
and decides the bound from those two conjuncts and `n <= 1073741823` by signed
order. It used to stop at the quantifier, so the preservation proof had to
state the unsigned bound itself.
