# `solve` proves element addresses distinct from their indices

`&q[j] != &q[0]` holds when `j != 0`: the two addresses are the exact scaled
offsets of one base. `solve`'s last strategy reads the goal as two element
addresses of one base with indices of one width and format (`int32`, or
64-bit of one signedness), states the index disequality with `have`, proved
by `solve`, and closes the goal with the library law
`separation::distinct_elements`. `click expand` writes those two steps, as
`explicit` does by hand. The indices are spelled from the index words, so
an `int32` word in arithmetic is `((m - 1) as int32)`.
`mdtests/solve_proves_element_addresses_distinct_at_each_index_type.md`
covers `size_t` and `long` indices and pure theorems.
