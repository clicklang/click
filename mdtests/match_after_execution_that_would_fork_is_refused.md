# A `match` after execution that would fork is refused

After execution each live arm of a `match` is a separate outcome path, as each arm of a proof `if` or `cases` that forks is. Tactics written after the `match` would then be checked once per arm, so the `match` is refused; the tactics belong in the arms.
