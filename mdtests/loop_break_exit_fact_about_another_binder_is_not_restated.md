# A fact about another binder is not restated about the renamed one

`inspect` holds two instances. Every `break` exit refolds `x` at a different
constructor, so the join gives `x`'s model a fresh name. No exit touches `y`,
and every exit states `y.model == old(y.model)`, which survives the join as
it always did, because every exit states that very fact.

Restating replaces an exit's value for the renamed binder, and only that. The
fact about `y` does not mention `x`'s value at any exit, so nothing is
restated about `x`, and the claim `x.model == old(y.model)` is refused. See
[`loop_break_exit_keeps_a_fact_every_exit_restates.md`](loop_break_exit_keeps_a_fact_every_exit_restates.md)
for the rule.
