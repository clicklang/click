# `simp` opens a call guarantee under its path condition

A callee's conditional guarantee reaches the caller as an implication,
`r == 0 implies cell[0] == 0 and cell[1] == at(before_probe, cell[0])`.
Inside the branch whose path condition is exactly that antecedent, `simp`
concludes the consequent by modus ponens: the checked `extract` rule's
indexed consequent lookup finds the implication and sees its antecedent
available, so no `extract` block is written and nothing is searched. The
goal names the `before_probe` snapshot as written, so it is looked up as
written rather than re-read at the branch's own program point, where
`cell[0]` has changed. `branching_graph_dfs.md` opens quantified
consequents the same way. The negative companion,
`simp_does_not_open_a_call_guarantee_off_its_path.md`, asks for the same
consequent on the other branch, where the antecedent is not available.
