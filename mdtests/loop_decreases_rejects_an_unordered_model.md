# a loop measure has to have an order

`decreases c.model;` names the binder's model itself, a `Chain`. A spec enum
has no order a ranking member can compare, so the measure is refused where it
is declared. The two spellings that do rank by the structure are the binder,
`decreases c;`, and a function of its model into `Integer` or `Nat`.

```c filename=loop_decreases_rejects_an_unordered_model.c
void countdown(int32 n) {
    while (n > 0) {
        n = n - 1;
    }
}
```
