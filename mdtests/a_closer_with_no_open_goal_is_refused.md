# A closer with no open goal is refused

The companion of `closers_after_execution_close_a_resource_goal_first.md`
with a second `normalize()`. Once both goals are closed there is nothing left
for a closer to act on, and the extra closer is refused rather than silently
ignored.

```c filename=a_closer_with_no_open_goal_is_refused.c
int32 g(int32 p[]) {
    return 7;
}
```

```click
verifying "a_closer_with_no_open_goal_is_refused.c";

int32 g(int32 p[]) {
    owns p[0..1];
    ensures result == 7;
} by {
    execute();
    assumption();
    normalize();
    normalize();
}
```

```expect
fail: `normalize` has no goal to close
```
