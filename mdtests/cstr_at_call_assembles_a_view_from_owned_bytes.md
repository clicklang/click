# A call assembles a viewed C string from the bytes its caller owns

`measure` owns the bytes `src[0..n + 1]` and states the facts of a C string of
length `n` in its precondition, but holds no `cstr_at` instance. The callee
views `cstr_at(src, n)`, so the call assembles one: the owned bytes cover the
string's body piecewise, and its four facts hold at the call. The caller's
bytes are lent for the call and returned unchanged; no `cstr_at` persists in
the caller. The quantified facts are the caller's own statements, matched to
the body's up to the quantifier's name.
[`cstr_at_call_assembly_needs_the_terminator_fact.md`](cstr_at_call_assembly_needs_the_terminator_fact.md)
is the refusal when a fact is missing.
