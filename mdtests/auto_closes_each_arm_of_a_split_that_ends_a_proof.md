# Each arm of a split that ends a proof closes its own claims

A proof `if` after execution whose condition is open on the outcome path splits
that path in two, and each arm finishes its own path, closing that arm's
goals: here two `solve()` steps close the first two claims in
each arm and the implicit closer the rest.
