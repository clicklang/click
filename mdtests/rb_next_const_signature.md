# `rb_next`'s `const` parameter and the cast that returns it

Linux declares `rb_next(const struct rb_node *node)` and returns the node its
descent reached as `(struct rb_node *)node`. The cast is how C says the caller
may write through a pointer the function itself only read through.

As in C, the result of an explicit cast has exactly the destination's pointee
qualification, so the unchanged signature and body are accepted. The rule is
documented in [the C0 reference](../docs/reference/language/c0.md);
[`c_const_cast_owned_write.md`](c_const_cast_owned_write.md) and
[`c_const_cast_storage_writes_rejected.md`](c_const_cast_storage_writes_rejected.md)
are its own regressions.

[`rb_next.md`](rb_next.md) still declares the parameter as
`struct rb_node *node`. Its proof was written against that signature and does
not go through unchanged with the `const` one, so this fixture pins only that
the unchanged translation unit is accepted. `rb_next.md` takes the `const`
back when its proof is adjusted.
