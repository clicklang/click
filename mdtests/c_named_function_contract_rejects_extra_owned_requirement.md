# A callback may not require ownership its named contract does not supply

The concrete callback's body writes only the first cell, but its published
contract requires ownership of two.  A named contract transferring only the
first cell cannot satisfy that extra requirement.

```c filename=extra_callback_resource_requirement.c
void needs_two_cells(int32* state) {
    state[0] += 1;
}

void apply_step(void (*step)(int32*), int32* cells) {
    step(cells);
}

void extra_resource_caller(int32* cells) {
    apply_step(&needs_two_cells, cells);
}
```
