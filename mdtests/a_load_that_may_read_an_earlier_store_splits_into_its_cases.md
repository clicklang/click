# A load that may read an earlier store's cell continues in each case

`g[u] = 7` may or may not write `g[0]`, so the load `r = g[0]` after it has
two checked successors: `r == 7` when `u == 0`, and `r == old(g[0])`
otherwise. The load is not the last statement, so each case has to continue with
the rest of the block under its own assumption.

`execute()` splits the proof on the case condition before the load and
runs the remaining statements once per case. The explicit form is the same
split written as a proof `if`, with plain `step()`s in each case: inside a
case the load has one successor.

Before, `execute()` stopped at the load with "requires exactly one
statement successor", because a planner step refused the split exactly as a
simple `step()` does.
