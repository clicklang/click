# simp follows a bound to another variable

In the loop body, `i + 1 <= 101` needs `i`'s bounds and then the bound on
the variable they name: `i < n` from the guard, and `n <= 100` from the
contract. simp's bound selection follows bounds from the goal's variables
to the variables they name, up to a fixed number of variables, and closes
the goal with one arithmetic certificate.

```c filename=simp_follows_a_bound_to_another_variable.c
int32 count_to(int32 n) {
    int32 i = 0;
    while (i < n) {
        i = i + 1;
    }
    return i;
}
```
