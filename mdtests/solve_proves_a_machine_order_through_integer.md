# The implicit closer proves a machine order through its `Integer` reading

A `uint64` or `int64` order goal is proved as the order of its operands'
`Integer` observations, and carried back to the machine order, which
lowers to the same fact.

```click
theorem machine_goal(i: uint64, n: uint64) {
    requires i < n;
    requires n <= 1000u64;
    ensures i < 1000u64 by {
        have i < 1000u64;
        assumption();
    }
}
```

```expect
pass
```
