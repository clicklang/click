# a loop measure over a model still has to decrease

The measure `chain_len(c.model)` is a function of the loop binder's model,
and the body never moves the binder: it spins while `n` is positive and hands
back the instance it started with. The back edge compares the measure against
itself, so the ranking member stays open. A model measure buys no leniency
over a C one; its obligation is the same strict decrease.
