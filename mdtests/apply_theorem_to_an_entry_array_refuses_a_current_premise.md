# a current-state premise may not discharge an entry-array requirement

The converse of `apply_theorem_to_an_entry_array.md`. The body clears `box[0]`,
so the theorem's requirement holds of the current array and fails of the entry
array. An application written at `old(box)` asks for the entry array, so the
current-state fact `box[0] < 1` is not its premise and the conclusion the
theorem would yield is about the entry cell, which is `7`.

The application used to drop the `old`, accept the current-state premise, and
state its conclusion about the current cell. That instantiation is a true
instance of the theorem — the parameter was uniformly bound to the current
memory, on both sides of the implication — so no false statement followed from
it, but the claim below is false and must not verify by any route.

    box[0] = box[1];

}
