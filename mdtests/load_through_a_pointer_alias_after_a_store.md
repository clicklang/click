# A read through one spelling sees a store through another

A resource arm names its cell by a model payload, `id->word`, and the C code
stores through a pointer it loaded, `p = c->up; p->word = 5;`. The arm's
fact `c->up == id` makes `p == id` provable. After the store, the value is
the same whichever spelling a proof reads it through, so `have id->word == 5`
holds exactly as `have p->word == 5` does.

Before, a specification read looked the cell up by its exact spelling only
and otherwise named a fresh load, so the read through `id` was unrelated to
the store through `p`. A read now also looks the cell up at the other
spellings of the same address that the path's pointer equalities give.

```c filename=arm_identity_loaded.c
struct node { unsigned long word; struct node *up; };

void set_up_word(struct node *c) {
    struct node *p;
    p = c->up;
    p->word = 5;
}
```

            fact c->up == id;
            fact id->word == value;
        },
    }
