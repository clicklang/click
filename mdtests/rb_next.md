# `rb_next` on the node-keyed model

This is the unchanged Linux `rb_next` with its complete contract: the returned
node is the in-order successor of `node` in the entry tree, or null when `node`
is last. The proof runs the descent to its `return`, the ascent loop through
its back edge and its three `break` exits, each loop with a structural
measure, and the section after the ascent that hands back the node the walk
stopped at. Every claim is certified on every path.
[`rb_next_rejects_a_dropped_context.md`](rb_next_rejects_a_dropped_context.md)
is its negative: a contract that drops the entry context is refused.

The C body is Linux `lib/rbtree.c`'s `rb_next` unchanged, with the two macros
it uses, `rb_parent` and `RB_EMPTY_NODE`, as `include/linux/rbtree.h` writes
them. One thing is translated: the parameter is `struct rb_node *node` rather
than `const struct rb_node *node`. The unchanged signature is accepted
([`rb_next_const_signature.md`](rb_next_const_signature.md) pins that), but
this proof was written against the unqualified one and does not go through
unchanged with `const`, so the translation stays until the proof is adjusted.
Dropping the qualifier changes no statement of the body.

## The model and the resources

The model is the node-keyed one of [`rb_first_last.md`](rb_first_last.md):
`RbTree::Node(identity, parent, color, left, right)` and the frames
`Context::Left`/`Context::Right(identity, grandparent, color, sibling, up)`.
`rb_next` takes only a node, so the frame resource is `ctx_at(child)` with no
`rb_root` argument, and `Context::Top` owns nothing.

Two facts are added to the arms, and they are what the function's first
statement needs. `rb_at`'s `Node` arm states `fact parent != p` and each frame
states `fact grandparent != identity`: a linked node is not its own parent.
`RB_EMPTY_NODE(node)` tests `node->__rb_parent_color == (unsigned long)node`,
which is how Linux marks a node that is in no tree. With the packed word stated
as `address(parent) + (word & 1)`, both pointers aligned, and the parent not the
node itself, the kernel decides that comparison false, so the proof takes
`if (RB_EMPTY_NODE(node)) return NULL;` with one `step()` and the early return
is unreachable for a node the contract describes. The contract does not cover a
cleared node; `rb_at` cannot be folded at one.

What ties the focused subtree to the frame above it is
`rb_ctx_linked(t.model, c.model) == 1`: the parent payload of the subtree's root
is the node the frame owns, or null under `Top`. Neither walk has a C local
holding that parent at its loop head — the ascent assigns `parent` inside its
guard — so the link is a predicate over the two models rather than a pair of
facts about a local, and both loops carry it.

## The contract

```text
consumes c: ctx_at(node);
consumes t: rb_at(node);
requires t.model != RbTree::Empty;
requires rb_ctx_linked(t.model, c.model) == 1;
produces ctx: ctx_at(result);
produces sub: rb_at(result);
produces rest: rb_remainder_at(result);
ensures result != 0 implies
    plug(ctx.model, sub.model) == plug(old(c.model), old(t.model));
ensures result != 0 implies rb_ctx_linked(sub.model, ctx.model) == 1;
ensures result != 0 implies
    rb_list_adjacent(rb_inorder(plug(old(c.model), old(t.model))), node, result) == 1;
ensures result == 0 implies
    rb_remainder_tree(rest.model) == plug(old(c.model), old(t.model));
ensures result == 0 implies
    rb_list_ends_with(rb_inorder(plug(old(c.model), old(t.model))), node) == 1;
```

A non-null result is handed back the way the entry node was taken: its frame
and its subtree, rebuilding the entry tree through `plug`, and linked, so the
caller can call `rb_next` again. `rb_list_adjacent(xs, a, b)` says that `b`
stands immediately after an occurrence of `a` in `xs`. The in-order list of an
owned tree has no repeated node, so this is the successor; the pure list does
not record distinctness, and the claim is stated in the form that needs none.

A null result means `node` was last: `rb_list_ends_with`. The walk has then
climbed to the root, and no clause can name that node through `result`, so the
whole tree comes back inside `rest`: `rb_remainder_at(result)` is
`Remainder::More` when the result is a node and `Remainder::Whole(top, tree)`,
owning `rb_at(top)`, when it is null. `ctx` and `sub` are then the empty
context and the empty tree at the null pointer.

The three produced binders, rather than one resource wrapping all the cases,
are what the descent needs: a loop binder has to carry a contract binder's
name, and the descent's frame stack cannot be called `c`, because the fold
that pushes the first frame consumes `c` as that frame's `up` child.

## The descent

`if (node->rb_right)` is decided by a proof `match` on the right child's model.
In the `Node` arm the proof folds the entry node into
`Context::Right(node, .., old(c.model))` over the entry context, steps to the
right child, and runs `while (node->rb_left) node = node->rb_left;` exactly as
`rb_first` does: each iteration unfolds the focused node, folds a `Left` frame
over it, and steps down, with `decreases t;` checked on the back edge.

The invariants are the link, `plug(ctx.model, t.model)` equal to the entry
tree, and `ctx_descends_from(ctx.model, old(node)) == 1`: the frames are `Left`
frames down from a `Right` frame whose node is the entry node. `plug_successor`
turns that, together with the result being the head of its own in-order list
(`rb_inorder_first_at_leftmost`), into the adjacency claim.

The entry context has no spelling inside this loop. `old(c.model)` in a loop
clause is read through the instance of that name the loop holds, and `c` is by
then a child of the first frame
([`loop_invariant_old_model_of_an_instance_folded_into_a_parent.md`](loop_invariant_old_model_of_an_instance_folded_into_a_parent.md)).
The proof therefore matches the frame it has just folded; the arm's last
binding, `above`, is the entry context, and the invariant is stated against
`plug(above, RbTree::Node(entry_identity, ..))`.

Both walks assign the parameter `node` and then pass it to theorems, and the
entry node is `old(node)` throughout. A theorem argument naming a pointer
parameter the body had assigned used to be read at its entry value; this change
repairs that
([`apply_argument_names_a_parameter_the_loop_reassigns.md`](apply_argument_names_a_parameter_the_loop_reassigns.md)).

## The ascent

C0 lowers `while ((parent = rb_parent(node)) && node == parent->rb_right)` into
a `while (1)` whose body starts with the assignment and an `if (!(..)) break;`.
The guard is therefore ordinary body statements, and the proof stands between
them: it unfolds the focused node, steps the masked load and the assignment,
refolds, and then matches the frame.

- `Context::Top`: the link gives a null parent, and the `if` breaks.
- `Context::Left`: the frame's node is `parent`, and `node` is its left child.
  The proof unfolds the frame and decides `node == parent->rb_right` false: an
  empty sibling is the null pointer, and a sibling that is a node owns cells
  `node`'s own subtree also would. It refolds the frame and breaks.
- `Context::Right`: the conjunction holds, `node = parent` runs, the node the
  frame owned is folded over the old subtree and its sibling, and the back edge
  hands on `up` with `decreases c;` checked.

The invariants are the link, `plug(c.model, t.model)` equal to the entry tree,
and `rb_list_ends_with(rb_inorder(t.model), old(node)) == 1`: the entry node,
which has no right child, stays last in the subtree the walk has rebuilt,
because every frame it consumed was a `Right` frame
(`rb_inorder_last_through_right`).

Both structural measures are on the unchanged loops. There is no counter, no
unrolling bound, and no size assumption.

The loop leaves by three `break` paths that hold the same two binders after
different work: the `Top` exit never opens the frame, and the `Left` exits
unfold and refold it, one of them after also opening the sibling. Joining them
needed two repairs to the exit join, which this change makes:
[`loop_break_exit_join_ignores_fold_order.md`](loop_break_exit_join_ignores_fold_order.md)
and
[`loop_break_exit_join_sets_aside_unshared_cells.md`](loop_break_exit_join_sets_aside_unshared_cells.md).

## After the ascent

The exits hold the frame at different terms, `Top` untouched and `Left(..)`
refolded, so the join gives the frame's model a fresh name. What every exit
stated about its own frame is restated about that name and kept
([`loop_break_exit_keeps_a_fact_every_exit_restates.md`](loop_break_exit_keeps_a_fact_every_exit_restates.md)):
the link, `ctx_is_right(c.model) == 0`, the plugged tree, and the entry node
being last in the rebuilt subtree. The proof then matches the frame.

- `Context::Top`: the link gives a null `parent`, which is the result. The
  frame owns nothing; the proof unfolds it, folds an empty `ctx` and `sub` at
  the null result, and hands the whole tree back in `rest` as
  `Remainder::Whole(node, t.model)`. `plug(Context::Top, t.model)` is the entry
  tree and the entry node is last in it.
- `Context::Left`: the frame's node is `parent`, the result. The proof unfolds
  the frame, folds `sub` at `parent` over the rebuilt subtree and the frame's
  sibling, and refolds the frame's `up` as `ctx` at `parent`, which takes a
  match on `up`'s model. `rb_inorder_adjacent_above` and `plug_keeps_adjacent`
  give the adjacency: the entry node is last in `parent`'s left subtree, so
  `parent` follows it.
- `Context::Right` is impossible: every exit stated `ctx_is_right(c.model) ==
  0`. The arm restates that at its constructor and refutes itself with a
  `contradiction` after the bridging `have`s
  ([`function_match_arm_closes_by_contradiction_after_a_have.md`](function_match_arm_closes_by_contradiction_after_a_have.md)).
