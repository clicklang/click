# a call owes an inline helper's precondition

`add_one`'s body is safe for every argument below the int32 maximum, but its
contract asks for `value < 100`. With a contract, a call applies the contract,
not the body, so `run` owes that precondition at the call, and `run`'s own
`value < 200` does not establish it. Before inline helpers applied their
contracts, the body ran at the call site and this was accepted.

The caller is listed before the helper, so this also pins that the contract
is in force whichever function the sidecar verifies first.

    return value + 1;

    return add_one(value);
