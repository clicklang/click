# A theorem argument naming a parameter the loop reassigns is read where the tactic stands

`skip` reassigns its pointer parameter `p` in a loop. Inside `preserve`, before
any statement of the body has run, the proof states a fact about `p` with a
`have` and then applies a theorem to `p`, citing that fact as the theorem's
premise.

The application used to be refused: the premise was reported unavailable
although the `have` immediately above it had recorded exactly that proposition.
The theorem's requirement instantiated to
`holds(Box::Box(p), array-ref(snapshot#1, p))`: the occurrence of `p` inside
the constructor was the loop head's value, and the occurrence passed directly
as a pointer argument was read at function entry. A pointer parameter has two
entries in a proof-side environment, its value and the array reference a
pointer-typed pure-function or theorem parameter binds, and only the value
followed the variable once the body assigned it. The two now agree: the
reference is read through the variable, like the value.

With the assignment `p = q` removed from the C body the proof always verified,
and `old(p)` still names the entry pointer. The unchanged Linux `rb_next`
reassigns its `node` parameter in both walks and applies theorems to it in each.

```c filename=skip.c
struct node { int32 value; };

struct node *skip(struct node *p, struct node *q, int32 n) {
    while (n > 0) {
        p = q;
        n = n - 1;
    }
    return p;
}
```
