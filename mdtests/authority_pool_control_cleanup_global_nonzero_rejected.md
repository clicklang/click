# Cleanup cannot infer global emptiness from owning no slots

This helper owns the control and no slots. Its authenticated entry count
is one, so exhausting its local ownership cannot justify retiring authority.
Writing the C capacity field to zero does not change the population.

```c filename=pool_destroy.c
struct pool {
    int32 checked_out;
    int32 capacity;
};

void pool_destroy(struct pool* pool) {
    pool->capacity = 0;
}
```

```c filename=payload.c
struct object { int32 value; };
```

```click

authorized resource pool_object(pool: struct pool*, object: struct object*) { owns *object; }
resource pool_control(pool: struct pool*) {
