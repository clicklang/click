# An owned open names the body fact its close cannot refold

An owner opens its C string and stores a nonzero byte inside it. The store
keeps the string valid, but the block states nothing about the new byte, so
the fold that closes `open` cannot re-establish the body's
`forall (k: uint64) { ... p[k] != '\0' }` at the new memory. The refusal
names that closing `fold` and the missing body fact, as an explicit `fold`
does; `cstr_at_owner_rewrites_a_byte_and_refolds_the_same_length.md` proves
the facts and refolds.
