# A widened unsigned sum cannot establish a smaller upper bound

The same operand bounds permit a sum of 4294967295. They cannot establish
an upper bound of 4294967294.

```c filename=widened_unsigned_sum_bounds.c
long add_byte(unsigned sum, unsigned char byte) {
    unsigned word = (unsigned)byte;
    long wide = (long)sum + (long)word;
    return wide;
}
```
