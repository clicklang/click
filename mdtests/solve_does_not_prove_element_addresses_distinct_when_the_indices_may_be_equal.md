# `solve` does not prove element addresses distinct when the indices may be equal

`0 <= j` admits `j == 0`, where `&q[j]` is `&q[0]`. `solve`'s element-address
strategy states `j != 0` and its nested `solve` misses, so the strategy
declines and `solve` reports its ordinary bounded miss.

    requires 0 <= j;
    ensures result == 0;
} by {
    have &q[j] != &q[0] by solve();
}
```

```expect
fail: could not establish `&q[j] != &q[0]`
