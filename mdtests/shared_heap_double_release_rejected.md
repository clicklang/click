# Releasing the same reference twice is refused

A caller holding one reference may release it once. The second release needs
another reference, which the caller does not hold, even though the count says
another reference exists elsewhere.

```c filename=shared_heap_double_release_rejected.c
struct child {
    int32 refs;
    int32 payload;
};

void child_release(struct child* obj) {
    if (obj->refs == 1) {
        free(obj);
    } else {
        obj->refs = obj->refs - 1;
    }
}

void release_twice(struct child* obj) {
    child_release(obj);
    child_release(obj);
}
```
