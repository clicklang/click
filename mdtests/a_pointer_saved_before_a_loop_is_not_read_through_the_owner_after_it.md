# A pointer saved before a loop is not read through the owner after it

`holder(h)` owns the cell `h->ptr` points at, an address its definition
reads out of memory. `f` saves `h->ptr`, then a loop swaps the pointers of
two holders, and `f` reads through the saved pointer with both holders
folded.

Before the loop, holding `holder(h)` lets C read `saved[0]`: it is the cell
the holder owns. After the loop it is not known to be: the loop may have
moved that cell to `holder(g)`. The read authority a holder gives is derived
again at the loop head over the memory an arbitrary visit sees, so it covers
the cell `h->ptr` points at then, and the read through `saved` is refused.

The read would in fact be safe here, since one of the two holders owns the
cell. `a_freed_cell_is_not_read_through_another_owner_after_a_loop.md` is the
same loop where it is not.

    while (i < 1) {
        t = h->ptr;
        h->ptr = g->ptr;
        g->ptr = t;
        i = i + 1;
    }
    return saved[0];
}
