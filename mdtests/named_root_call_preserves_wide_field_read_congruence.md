# A named root-link call preserves wide field-read congruence

The helper changes only the root link. Nested modeled children retain their
pointer identities when the root changes. After the call, `near == rid`
implies equal reads of their eight-byte tag in the same current memory.
The 32-bit counterpart already worked through the int32 equality graph;
the wide route must preserve all eight bytes and the recorded read snapshots.
The subsequent store also preserves current-read congruence and supplies its
exact wide value through the recorded pointer alias.

```c filename=probe.c
struct node { unsigned long tag; struct node *left; struct node *right; };
struct root { struct node *node; };
void helper(struct node *p, struct node *q, struct root *root) { root->node = q; }
void probe(struct node *p, struct root *root) {
    struct node *cursor = p->right;
    struct node *near = cursor->left;
    p->right = near;
    cursor->left = p;
    helper(p, cursor, root);
    cursor = near;
    near = cursor->right;
    near->tag = 0;
}
```
