# A model-field pointer to another struct fails the loop join

The packed word's origin is a model field declared `struct other_node*`. The
decoded pointer designates a `struct other_node`, not the `struct model_node`
that `p` designates at the loop head. The back edge would change `p`'s object
class, so the loop join refuses it. The join does not take the head's class,
and the cast's destination type supplies no class. Compare
`packed_model_pointer_loop_object_class.md`, where the field declares the
same struct and the proof verifies.

```c filename=packed_other.c
struct model_node { uint64 parent_word; };
struct other_node { uint64 parent_word; };
void follow_model(struct model_node* p, int32 more) {
    while (more) { p = (struct model_node*)p->parent_word; more = more - 1; }
}
```
