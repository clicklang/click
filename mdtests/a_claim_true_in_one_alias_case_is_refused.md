# A claim true in only one alias case of a load is refused

The negative of
[`a_load_that_may_read_an_earlier_store_splits_into_its_cases.md`](a_load_that_may_read_an_earlier_store_splits_into_its_cases.md).
`r = g[0]` reads the `7` that `g[u] = 7` stored only when `u == 0`; for any
other `u` it reads the entry value. `execute()` splits the load into those two
cases and continues each, and the claim `result == 8` holds only in the first.
The refusal is the ordinary unclosed goal of the other case, where the result
is the entry value of `g[0]` plus one. Its proof context names that case,
`0 == u is false`, on a line of its own: the condition shares no term with the
goal, while the unrelated `requires u < 4` stays out.

```c filename=a_claim_true_in_one_alias_case_is_refused.c
int32 g[4];

int32 planned(int32 u) {
    int32 r;
    g[u] = 7;
    r = g[0];
    r = r + 1;
    return r;
}
```

} by {
    execute();
    simp();

proof context for the goal:
