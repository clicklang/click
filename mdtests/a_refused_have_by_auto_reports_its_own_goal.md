# A refused have with its proof omitted reports its own goal

A `have ...;` with its proof omitted that the implicit closer cannot prove inside a theorem's
`ensures ... by` block is refused at that `have`, with the `have`'s goal,
not declined to the enclosing claim. The `have` is false: nothing bounds
`word & 1`.

    ensures to_integer(word) == to_integer(base) by {
        have (word & 1) == 0;
