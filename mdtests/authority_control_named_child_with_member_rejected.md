# A named child that holds a population member is refused

A named child beside the control's authority must not hide a population
member: a child whose definition owns a member reaches the population, so the
control cannot be folded or unfolded through the ordinary named exchange.


```c filename=authority_control_named_child_with_member_rejected.c
struct box { int32 used; int32 hits; };
int32 run() {
    struct box* b = malloc(sizeof(struct box));
    if (b == 0) return -1;
    b->used = 0;
    b->hits = 5;
    b->used = b->used + 1;
    b->used = b->used - 1;
    free(b);
    return 0;
}
