# `solve` proves element addresses distinct at each index type

Variants of
`mdtests/solve_proves_element_addresses_distinct_from_their_indices.md`. A
`size_t` index beside the literal `0` is compared as `uint64`, and the literal
is spelled `0u64` (`words`, `last64`); a `long` index is compared as `int64`
(`longs`). In a pure theorem the indices are the theorem's parameters.
