# Writing another descriptor of the region's type after unfolding it

The region is unfolded while the second `struct slot` still holds its
materialized cells, then the C writes that descriptor's `at` and `pool`
fields. The descriptor `*s` and `*other` are then two owned
members of the frame, so the writes leave `s->pool` in place. The proof
explicitly preserves the backing `data` pointer across each store, allowing
the fold to consume the range the unfold produced.

```c filename=unfold_region_then_write_a_descriptor_of_its_type.c
struct pool {
    int32* data;
    int32 n;
};

struct slot {
    struct pool* pool;
    int32 at;
    int32 end;
};

int32 peek(struct slot* s, struct slot* other) {
    struct pool* pool;

    other->at = 7;
    other->pool = 0;
    pool = s->pool;
    return pool->n;
}
```

resource pool_state(pool: struct pool*) {
    field live: int32;
    owns pool->data;
