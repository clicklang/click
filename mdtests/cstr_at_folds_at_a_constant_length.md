# A C string folds at a constant length

A `fold` whose body fact is not available exactly leaves it to the fold's
implicit `auto`, spelled over the fold's arguments as written. A constant
argument is spelled as its literal, so `fold(cstr_at(p, 1u64))` proves its
quantified body facts from the caller's `requires` as `fold(cstr_at(p, n))`
does. Before, a constant argument had no spelling and the fold was refused at
the first quantified body fact, with a note that the available fact printed
identically. `empty` folds the empty string, whose nonzero-byte fact ranges
over no byte.
