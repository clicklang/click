# A fact about a `const` pointer parameter survives a C step

`peek` takes `const struct node* p`. Unfolding `x` publishes the body fact
`same(p, p) == 1`, and after a C step the proof still finds it by
`assumption`.

It used to be lost. Whether a pointer's pointee is `const` was part of the
pointer value's identity, so the fact built from the instance's argument and
the parameter read back after the step, with its declared `const`, were two
different terms for one pointer. Constness is now carried beside the value
and left out of its identity: it is a property of the access path, which the
write checks read, and two pointers that differ only in it designate the same
object. Writes through a `const` view are still refused
(`const_pointer_write_rejected.md`, `const_pointer_cast_write_rejected.md`),
and a fact about `p` says nothing about another pointer
([`const_pointer_parameter_fact_does_not_name_another_pointer.md`](const_pointer_parameter_fact_does_not_name_another_pointer.md)).

```c filename=const_parameter_fact.c
struct node { int32 shade; };

int32 peek(const struct node* p) {
    int32 seen = 0;
    return 0;
}

    fact same(p, p) == 1;

int32 peek(const struct node* p) {
    owns x: here(p);
    ensures result == 0;

    let x = fold(here(p), { tag: 0 });
