# a user-defined tactic reshapes the resources a proof holds

`divide` is a user-defined tactic. Its contract consumes one instance owning
`p->a` and `p->b` and produces two, one per cell, with a fact about the first.
Its `by` block proves that contract once, by unfolding and folding; no C runs.

`user` applies it as one step, `let { y: y, z: z } = divide(p) { x: x };`, which
binds `divide`'s `x` to the instance `user` holds and names the two it gets
back. An application changes only which instances the proof holds and adds the
tactic's `ensures`; memory is untouched, so the requirement `p->b == 5` still
holds afterwards and proves the result.
