# `snprintf` with a literal format states each character it writes

A call to `snprintf` whose format is a string literal calls a function with
one parameter per conversion. Its contract is written from the format: the
result is the number of characters the format produces, and each character
within the first `size - 1` is stated with the decimal rendering functions of
`click::format`. `decimal_length_n` gives an `n`-digit value's length,
`decimal_digit_of_length` a digit, and `pow10_e` a power of ten.

`".%03u"` is the fraction `string_get_size` in Linux `lib/string_helpers.c`
writes: a `.` and three digits, zero-padded.

```c filename=snprintf_digits.c
int snprintf(char *buf, unsigned long size, const char *fmt, ...);

int render(char *buf, unsigned int n)
{
	return snprintf(buf, 8, "%u", n);
}

int fraction(char *tmp, unsigned int remainder)
{
	return snprintf(tmp, 12, ".%03u", remainder);
}
```
