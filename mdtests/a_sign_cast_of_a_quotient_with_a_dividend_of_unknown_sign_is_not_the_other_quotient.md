# A sign cast of a quotient with a dividend of unknown sign is not the other quotient

The refusal beside
`a_sign_cast_of_a_nonnegative_quotient_is_the_quotient_at_the_other_signedness.md`:
rule C needs the dividend's `int32` reading known nonnegative. Here it is
not, and the two sides differ: for `n == 4294967295u` and `d == 2u`,
`(int)(n / d)` is `2147483647` while `(int)n / (int)d` is `-1 / 2`, `0`.

int unsigned_quotient_read_signed(unsigned n, unsigned d) {
    return (int)(n / d) == (int)n / (int)d;
