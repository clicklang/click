# A store search miss names the store and the fact for a heap read

`q[0] = 7; q[m - 1] = 1;` with `1 <= m` and `m == 2 or m == 8` writes two
different elements, so the later read `int r = q[0];` is the `7`. The store
keeps the cached `q[0]` only on a stated disequality of the two `int32` index
words. The implicit tail spells `((m - 1) as int32) != 0` before the store
and tries to prove it by arithmetic, but its narrow closure does not split
the disjunction, so the store drops `q[0]` and the read is unknown.

The refusal names the statement whose store dropped the cell and the exact
fact the search spelled, so a proof can state it before that statement with
`step_until(statement(3)); have ... by solve();`.

```c filename=a_store_search_miss_names_the_store_and_the_fact_for_a_heap_read.c
int read_first(int m) {
    int *q = malloc(m * sizeof(int));
    if (q == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    q[0] = 7;
    q[m - 1] = 1;
    int r = q[0];
    free(q);
    return r;
}
```

```expect
fail: statement(3) may have overwritten `q[0]`; it is kept if you state `have ((m - 1) as int32) != 0 by { ... };` before statement(3)
