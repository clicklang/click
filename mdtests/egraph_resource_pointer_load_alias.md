# Resource-published pointer loads through a proved-equal model identity

Unfolding owns one pointer cell and proves its parameter equal to the model
identity. No C read, write, recursive resource, or snapshot transport is involved.
Address congruence must also give equality of the specification pointer loads.

```c filename=resource_pointer_load_alias.c
struct node { struct node *next; };
void check(struct node *p) {}
