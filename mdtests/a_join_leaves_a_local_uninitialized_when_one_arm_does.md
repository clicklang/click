# A local one arm never initialized is uninitialized after the join

Only the `then` arm of the C `if` gives `t` a value. On the path through the
`else` arm `t` was never written, so after the arms join, reading `t` is as
undefined as it was on that path, and the `return t` is refused.

The arm that did initialize `t` does not carry its value past the join. If
it did, the two arms would describe `t` differently and could not be joined
at all; that used to make the automatic loop closer walk such arms as
separate paths.
