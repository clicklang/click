# An exit that called a function with a local joins one that did not

`paint` leaves its `while (true)` by a `break` on both paths, and both paths
leave `p->shade` holding 0. One path stores the 0 itself; the other calls
`repaint`, which declares a local. `repaint` has no Click contract, so its body
runs at the call site, on `paint`'s own memory.

The two exits hold the same cells and own the same resources. They differ in
what the path recorded about automatic storage: the calling path's memory
holds a tombstone for `repaint`'s ended `next` and the forget mark that
retiring its cell left, and the calling path has taken one identity from the
counter that names re-entered declarations. The join reconciles each:

- the successor holds the union of the exits' tombstones;
- its counter is the largest of theirs, so no ended block's identity is
  issued again;
- its memory keeps the cells every exit holds and takes a freshly minted
  snapshot identity, with no recorded history, so a later load of a cell it
  does not hold is related to no earlier load.

The unchanged Linux `__rb_insert` needs this: its rotation exits call
`__rb_rotate_set_parents`, which declares `parent`, and its early exits do
not. What the fresh identity gives up is pinned by
[`loop_break_exit_after_a_call_keeps_cells_every_exit_holds.md`](loop_break_exit_after_a_call_keeps_cells_every_exit_holds.md);
a loop whose exits agree keeps its memory's identity
([`loop_break_exit_ordinary_join_keeps_post_loop_read.md`](loop_break_exit_ordinary_join_keeps_post_loop_read.md)).
