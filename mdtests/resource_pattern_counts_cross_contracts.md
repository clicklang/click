# Resource-pattern counts cross opaque contracts

A wildcard resource count remains active when it is zero. Opaque calls that
produce or consume an exact matching resource update the aggregate count, so a
predicate relating C memory to that count can be re-established modularly.

Each member privately owns the exact abstract `available(object)` token.
Checkout transfers that token into the new member; return releases it while
consuming one member. Return accepts an arbitrary population total: custody of
one member supplies the decrement bound, without claiming that no other member
has the same object argument. The roundtrip restores the caller's token and
count predicate. All three C programs are unchanged.

```c filename=resource_pattern_count_checkout.c
struct pool {
    int32 checked_out;
};

void pool_checkout(struct pool* pool, int32 object) {
    pool->checked_out = pool->checked_out + 1;
}
```

```c filename=resource_pattern_count_return.c
struct pool {
    int32 checked_out;
};

void pool_return(struct pool* pool, int32 object) {
    pool->checked_out = pool->checked_out - 1;
}
```

```c filename=resource_pattern_count_roundtrip.c
struct pool {
    int32 checked_out;
};

void pool_roundtrip(struct pool* pool, int32 object) {
    pool_checkout(pool, object);
    pool_return(pool, object);
}
```
