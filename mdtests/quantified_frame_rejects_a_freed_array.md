# a separated array is not framed across its own release

`data` is consumed and released by `free`. Separation from the rest of the
contract says nothing about liveness, and the released cells are not framed
back to their entry values.

```c filename=quantified_frame_rejects_a_freed_array.c
void dispose(int32 *data, int32 n) { free(data); }
```
