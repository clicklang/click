# a quantified frame checks the guard it admits as well as the body

The store `v[i] = 0` can make the guard `v[k] == 0` hold at `k == i` where
it did not at entry, and nothing says `w[i] == 1`. The guard's own read is
framed in the opposite direction from the body's, and it is not unchanged, so
the transport is refused.

    v[i] = 0;
}
