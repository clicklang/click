# Rewrite a pointer into a shifted byte view

The shifted range keeps its endpoint expression `(i + 4) - i`. After
rewriting the model pointer, the goal names the same address and snapshot
with a literal four-byte extent. The checked viewability comparison recognizes
that structural constant without changing the stored range or reading
unrelated facts.
