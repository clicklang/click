# A loop writing past a sibling field forgets the union view it reaches

The loop writes the union member through a pointer to the struct's first
field, `p[1]` with `p = &source.tag`, so no spelling of the store names the
member. The loop head forgets every cached value nothing protects, and a
typed union view is one of them: it used to survive, the load after the loop
read the copied 3, and the false `ensures result == 3` verified, although
`loop_writes_past_tag` returns 9.

```c filename=a_loop_writing_past_a_sibling_field_forgets_the_union_view.c
union payload {
    int32 number;
    int32* pointer;
};

struct packet {
    int32 tag;
    int32 pad;
    union payload payload;
};

struct packet g;

int32 loop_writes_past_tag() {
    struct packet source;
    int32* p;
    int32 i;
    source = g;
    p = &source.tag;
    i = 0;
    while (i < 2) {
        p[2] = 9;
        i = i + 1;
    }
    return source.payload.number;
}
```
