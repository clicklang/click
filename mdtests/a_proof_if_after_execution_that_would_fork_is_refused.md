# A proof `if` after execution that would fork the proof is refused

After `execute()`, `n < 5` is not decided on the function's one outcome path,
so each arm would be a separate path. What follows a proof `if` is checked
once: the `simp()` after this one would instead run once per arm, and a run of
such `if`s would check the rest of the proof once per combination of arms.
The `if` is refused, as an execution-frontier `if` whose arms do not rejoin
is (`proof_if_arms_must_rejoin.md`).

        have n <= 10 by assumption();
