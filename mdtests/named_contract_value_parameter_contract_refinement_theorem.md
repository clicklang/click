# A contract refines another with value parameters on both

An abstract refinement theorem may relate contracts with value parameters,
each fact fixing its own: from `Adds(f, { amount: 3 })` it concludes
`Shifts(f, { offset: 3 })`. Unfolding both binds `amount` and `offset` to
the facts' values.

int32 unused(int32 x) {

contract int32 Adds(int32 x) {
    let amount: int32;
    requires 0 <= x and x <= 1000;
    requires 0 <= amount and amount <= 1000;
    ensures result == x + amount;
}

contract int32 Shifts(int32 x) {
    let offset: int32;
    requires 0 <= x and x <= 1000;
    requires 0 <= offset and offset <= 1000;
    ensures result == x + offset;
}
